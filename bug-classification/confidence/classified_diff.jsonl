[Middle Discussions Snipped for Brevity] ...\n- Was testing out Alacritty earlier today and ran into this. Built from master (using Rust 1.16.0), running on Arch Linux, and it only happens when I set the font size to something smaller than `10.0` (though the \"breaking point\" appears to be at `9.5` but I initially wanted to set it to `9.0`).\n- You've got what may be a duplicate bug here: #185 \r\n\r\nI'll cross-post some digging I did (seems to have to do with pitch and width calculations, and perhaps width being larger than pitch?):\r\n\r\nI've run into this issue as well (specifically the 'index 68 out of range for slice of length 64' version of the panic). Here is some gdb info at the point where the panic occurs in font/src/mod.rs:\r\n```\n(gdb) next\r\n212             let mut packed = Vec::with_capacity((bitmap.rows() * bitmap.width()) as usize);\r\n(gdb)\r\n213             for i in 0..bitmap.rows() {\r\n(gdb)\r\n...

My stopgap is to replace line 216 in mod.rs with:\r\n```\r\nlet stop = cmp::min(buf.len() as usize, start + bitmap.width() as usize);\r\n```\r\n...but I'm sure there's a better way.

However we also have the ability to reconfigure the cluster while it \nis running. So for instance I've hash slot 100 that is assigned to node A. And I want to move it to node B. \n\nThis is accomplished (and redis-trib is already able to do it for you automatically) with the following steps. \n\n1) Node A hash slot 100 is marked as \"Migrating to B\" (using the CLUSTER SETSLOT   MIGRATING   command). \n2) Node B hash slot 100 is marked as \"Importing from A\" (using the \nCLUSTER SETSLOT   IMPORTING   command). \n3) An external client, usually redis-trib, starts using the commands \nCLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT and the MIGRATE command to atomically move keys from A to B.\n\nWhat is interesting is that while the hash slot is set as \"Migrating  to B\", node A will reply to all the requests about this hash slot of keys that are _still_ present in the hash slot, but if a request is about a key that is in hash slot 100 but is not \nfound inside the key space, it generates a \"-ASK\" error, that is like \"-MOVED\" but means: please only ask this exact query to the specified node, but don't update your table about it. Ask new queries about hash \nslot 100 to me again. \n\nThis way all the new keys about hash slot 100 are created directly in B, but A handles all the queries about keys that are still in A. At the same time redis-trib moves keys from A to B. Eventually all the keys are moved and the hash slot configuration is consolidated to the new one, using other CLUSTER SETSLOT subcommands. \nSo far this is pretty cool.

While doing that, we encountered many times the error reported below, which forced us to manually kill the instance using kill -9 and reload it.\r\n\r\nIn normal operation the node has been working for months without any problems. The only special thing about it is that there are some very big keys to migrate; for those usually we expected a timeout in the migration, but previously we didn't have this error which forces us to restart the node.\r\n\r\nresharding log:\r\nMoving slot 7929 from  :  to  : : .................$\r\nMoving slot 7930 from  :  to  : : .................$\r\nMoving slot 7931 from  :  to  : : .................$\r\nMoving slot 7932 from  :  to  : : .................$\r\n[ERR] Calling MIGRATE: Connection timed out\r\n\r\nredis log:\r\n\r\n```\n=== REDIS BUG REPORT START: Cut & paste starting from here ===\r\n29395:M 31 Jan 22:16:03.248 # Redis 3.2.3 crashed by signal: 11\r\n29395:M 31 Jan 22:16:03.248 # Crashed running the instuction at:  \r\n29395:M 31 Jan 22:16:03.248 # Accessing address: (nil)\r\n29395:M 31 Jan 22:16:03.248 # Failed assertion:   ( :0)\r\n...

That would be very useful. Thanks!\n- Hi Salvatore\r\n\r\nWe stopped resharding the data because this happened quite a few times, but we didn't change anything since then so I'm pretty sure it would happen again if we tried. Did you publish anything new in the meantime? We could restart the sharding, but as it takes a few hours to reload this too big instance when it crashes, I'd rather not do it just to see if it will crash again...\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want any additional details.\n- ... [Middle Discussions Snipped for Brevity] ...\n- UPDATE: disassembling the `redis-server` executable it is quite clear that the problem is that the `port` parameter of the function is NULL. Should be easy to understand why, so I'm going to figure out when this happens.\n- Hello again @danmaz74 and @damaru00. I just tracked the bug cause and I'm preparing a fix. It looks like that regardless of the bug, that crashed the server, the migration is not going to work anyway because of a connection error happening while the big key is being migrated, but we can investigate this later as a second step after you upgrade the instance to a version that no longer crashes :-)"}
