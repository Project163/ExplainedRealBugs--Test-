The input thread simply writes to the file descriptor when it has data to write. The only way to test if this is true would be implementing an actual event loop for I/O. The easiest way to do that is dropping mio into the pty thread and sending all writes from the input handling over the mio channel.\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- I actually managed to reproduce it with a slightly simpler tmux arrangement. It did not seem to be an issue when there was not a vertical split on the bottom.

It looks like alacritty depends on [Link: glutin] which for linux depends on [Link: winit] and I found the following lines are commented out in the most recent version [Link: src/api/x11/events.rs#L177] and [Link: src/api/x11/events.rs#L270].\r\n\r\nThis seems to be relevant to my issue but I am unsure why it has been commented out. If this is the reason then the layout of my keyboard is irrelevant and most likely other linux users would have the same problem.\r\n\r\nHaving encountered the issue while using alacritty I'm submitting an issue here but should I also post an issue on winit? Or is there another reason for this issue?\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- This problem would need to be fixed upstream in `winit` as you've suggested. Alacritty is actually on an older for of `glutin` from before the split, and so there would still be some work here to get an upstream patch.\n- I'll see if I can fix it tomorrow. Any particular reason you are using an older version of `glutin`? Is it changing too often?\n- There was a couple of features needed for this project that I was having trouble getting feedback on. Specifically, keyboard modifiers needed to be parsed out of the underlying windowing system event and passed with `glutin::Event::KeyboardInput`. I also needed the received `char`(s) to be passed with the event. The latter feature was necessary for either running a key binding or printing the character. For example, you wouldn't want `Command-C` to also print a `c` when trying to copy the selection.\n- In any case, it's on my list to try and upstream the patches and get back on the main glutin tree.\n- I found a fix for this issue! Here are the diffs that I am applying on top of [URL] which is the version of glutin alacritty currently depends on:\r\n\r\n```\ndiff\r\ndiff --git a/src/api/x11/events.rs b/src/api/x11/events.rs\r\nindex 4754b1dc..5345af35 100644\r\n--- a/src/api/x11/events.rs\r\n+++ b/src/api/x11/events.rs\r\n...

This works for me so I just wanted to share! 😃 \r\n\r\nIt's possible other useful keys are not yet enabled but I haven't encountered them yet.\r\n\r\nGreat work with alacritty! I see it's becoming very popular, definitely deserved!\n- Should be fixed by [URL]\n- Can we confirm this is fixed ? If so, the issue can be closed\n- if you  can see the mentioned PR isn't yet landed."}

Hopefully this will provide some extra testing scenarios.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to point to the general direction where this sort of thing is handled in the alacritty codebase? Maybe as a beginner task that is easy to fix?\n- The logic for when to skip a cell [Link: is in term.rs]. It uses [Link: `Cell::is_empty()`] for checking if the cell should normally be displayed. The `is_empty()` logic should be updated for other non-printable characters.\r\n\r\nEdit: perhaps using [URL]\n- The problem seems to be elsewhere. I completely commented out the skipping code in term.rs but the output still looks exactly the same, so this issue is either not related to blank characters, or it's located elsewhere in the code.\n- I can confirm what @d3rrial has described. I tried to comment out the is_empty code and the issue still persists.\r\n\r\nI think if you have a theme like gruvbox in vim that isn't rendering properly the problem becomes a little bit more interactive / visible. It seems that you just simply can't \"reach\" these characters that aren't being rendered.\r\n\r\nI'll try and record a gif or a video to demonstrate or maybe try to print out the on the screen what characters are in the empty space.\n- Here is a gif of me moving around in vim a little bit and adding some text. Hopefully this helps to visualise the issue a little more. \r\n\r\n[Image: gif of issue]\r\n\r\nI'\n...[Middle Discussions Snipped]...\nhis correctly. Could somebody explain to me what is actually going on in this part of the code?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here i'm assuming the `scroll_region.end` is the end of everything that should be visible on screen. In other words I was guessing that this code is to do with shifting the view up so that the line out of view can be rendered. If that makes any sort of sense.\n- Oh right I guess maybe this is for movement rather that input, I'll keep looking for where white space characters are actually handled as input\n- Actually the gif I posted above explains this quite nicely. You can see the `linefeed` debug being printed out even though nothing new is really being rendered. Could this bit of code be to do with moving at all - rather than just rendering \"new\" things on screen?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think it may be easier to see this and find the code responsible with a step through debugger. I'm heading off for a little bit now - but maybe by the time I get back somebody would've beat me to the bug fix :P\r\n\r\nEDIT EDIT: I'm going to throw a guess out there and say that the easiest place to fix this would be the renderer? Although it would be more desirable to fix it further up the chain where it is easier to unit test.

It seems like ranger uses the current color of the file type to draw the background. However in alacritty it doesn't seem to take into account that the bold text changed the color and instead uses the non bright color to draw the bg strip.\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- There's a config option to draw bold text with bright colors. Please make sure you've got that enabled and that your bright colors are configured differently than normal colors.\n- If you mean `draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true` then I have that activated, yes.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the screenshot, the bold text has a different color than the bg color with alacritty.\r\nHere is my color settings:\r\n```\n# Colors (Tomorrow Night Bright)\r\ncolors:\r\n  # Default colors\r\n  primary:\r\n    background: ' '\r\n...

I did take a look at where the bright color computation happens and I think that it happens too late in the pipeline to be able to handle this.\r\n\r\nBecause as it is now, the fg and bg colors are split of long before the bright check happens.

It took a while for me to figure out which size the font wanted.\r\n\r\n@jwilm In most other programs I used, it either auto adjusts the size to the nearest correct one, or it prints out the available font sizes. Perhaps alacritty could do something like this?\r\n\r\nI would be really happy if it for example printed out this instead:\r\n```\r\nAlacritty encountered an unrecoverable error:\r\n\r\n\tInvalid pixel size: 10.

When configuring alacritty for the Terminus font with size 32.0, `/usr/share/fonts/terminus/ter-112n.pcf.gz` gets picked (size 12). This, regardless of the font size that is passed to the match. I have lots of other `ter*.pcf.gz` files for other sizes, of course, and fontconfig prints _something_ about them.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is the font size disagreement inside freetype2 or around alacritty's use of it - I am not sure, have not delved into these pieces of code too much.\n- [Link: Tamzen] used with `Tamzen for Powerline` works with `size: 9.0` but nothing else\n- I've managed to fix this problem in pull request #776, more testers are welcomed."}

The value reaches its maximum value (274 in my case) and stays there, pressing  Ctrl +  further has no effect. Pressing  Ctrl -  once reduces font size to 272.\r\n- Now hold  Ctrl - . The value reaches its minimum value (2 in my case), but further presses of  Ctrl -  change the value to 2, again and again. If I press  Ctrl -  10 times after I already reached the minimal value of 2, then pressing  Ctrl +  once will have no effect - the font size will stay at 2. I have to press  Ctrl +  10 times to compensate for my earlier actions, before further presses of  Ctrl +  begin to actually increase the font.\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- I can confirm this too.\n- I don't believe that #949 fixed the issue described in [URL]\r\n\r\nThe issue is with this call to Atlas#insert. If the font size is increased until it is too big to fit into a single atlas, Atlas#insert will always return an Err. This leads to load_glyph recursing infinitely, since inserting the glyph into an Atlas will never succeed.\n- @Aaron1011 It does actually fix the issue tho. The issue was never that the glyph was too big for a single atlas. Have you tested it out yourself? With #949 the crash doesn't happen anymore when increasing font size. The problem was that the atlas never changed, so there was never a new atlas that was created.\r\n\r\nIn theory you could run into problems with glyphs being too big for a single atlas, but I don't think that's even possible to happen because of gpu restrictions. I've played around with it a bit myself and the max font size goes up to a limit and then just stops. The worst thing I was able to reconstruct was that a few glyphs didn't show up anymore because my gpu driver was spouting errors about textures being too big. I don't think fitting a single glyph into an empty atlas has ever been the actual issue. Or can you still reproduce the issue after #949.\r\n\r\nI did initially play with changing the recursion strategy, but it turned out for me that after I fixed the obvious problem, all the other issues were resolved too."}

It also results linefeeds to be eaten, so multiple lines become One (like a coherent group of superheroes ;-)).\n- On a brief observation what I see is that alacritty inserts **\\n** within the paste buffer while xterm inserts **\\r** there. I have the feeling that CR and LF is mixed up on pasting (both reading and writing side, possibly).\n- When pasting a single `\\n`, `nano` behaves as if `^J` or `F4` (justify paragraph) had been pressed:\r\n\r\nBefore pasting:\r\n after`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"420\" alt=\"3\" src=\"[URL]\n- In case it matters (probably not, but it may spare duplication of efforts):\r\n\r\nI verified (on macOS) that `nano` does *not* set alacaritty in bracketed paste mode (`nvim` does).\r\n\r\nAltering `input.rs` to always force bracketed paste does alter the behaviour in `nano`, but unfortunately the new behaviour, too,  is incorrect.\r\n\r\nUse `echo -e '\\e[?2004h'` if you are curious to test it yourself: no need to alter `input.rs` and recompile (see [URL]\n- Apparently, non-bracketed pasting *is* the issue here.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"enter\" key is hit, a `CR` (`^M`) is generated (see [URL]\r\n\r\nIn non-bracketed mode, `LF`s (`^J`) in pasted data have to be replaced with `CR`s in order to simulate keypresses.\r\n\r\nIn non-bracketed mode, applications have no way of distinguishing if data comes from the keyboard or the clipboard, so it seems sensible that a terminal must simulate keypresses.\r\n\r\nTo me it is not 100% clear to what extent a terminal is supposed to do that (ie: whether octets corresponding to other control characters or maybe to bytes with the high bit set should be processed). Maybe data bytes should be interleaved with `^V`s? Or maybe bracketed mode is how pasting is supposed to work and applications that don't use it are at fault?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, replacing `\\r` with `\\n` seems an improvement and it is what [Link: jediterm] does."}

It seems to me like Alacritty is following a bad example here.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Also, just to list another advantage: It seems like currently we're trying to match urxvt, but this requires adding an additional special case to our codebase. If we'd stick with XTerm's behavior the code would actually be simpler from what I can tell.\n- Okay, I've compared `urxvt`, `XTerm` and `Alacritty`, I've excluded `Termite` because it does not invert the cell color for selection. I'd say `urxvt` has some edge-cases where things are weird and it does not handle the `Hidden` attribute at all (neither does `Alacritty` at the moment). In contrast `XTerm` is very consistent and supports the `Hidden` attribute.\r\n\r\nIn `XTerm` no matter which circumstances are present, the foreground color and background color are always inversed upon selection, even if the cell is `Hidden`, the foreground color which would be present is still used for the inverse. Rendering text with the same foreground and background color on top of each other also doesn't exhibit any special behavior, it is rendered as \"invisible\" (see Screenshot in previous comment) and when inversed with selection, the cells simply do not change at all (it inverses from red on red to red on red).\r\n\r\nI think this makes the most sense, it should be easy to implement and come without any surprises for the user. I'll send a PR which implements this behavior if anyone is interested in giving it a shot.\n- btw, did you test with transparency? Some of our logic is specifically around handling that properly.\n- I did not, but that's a great point, I'll throw that in too."}

Alacritty should not be truncating scroll values; if they were guaranteed to be integers, then winit wouldn't use floats there in the first place. The meaning of a fractional line delta is literally a fraction of a line (or more generally, a scroll unit). Smooth scrolling devices are not in general directly related to pixels, after all.\n- @Ralith thank you for the clarification! For some reason I had it in my head that smooth scrolling would always use pixels as a reference.\n- Is this a new issue? I just started using alacritty and it just so happens that I encountered this issue just now.\n- 8a65870 fixes this. I'm unfamiliar both with Rust and with alacritty's structure, so this is indubitably the wrong way to do it (the state is getting passed all over the place, I used terrible names, and it's largely just a result of changing stuff until the compiler was happy without really knowing what I was doing). A review of how I should have done this would be very welcome :)\n- @lheckemann not a new issue, but I don't think a lot of people were likely to encounter it. It requires running x11 on a laptop with a trackpad that generates fractional line deltas in an application that supports scrolling with someone who uses the mouse in terminal. Probably why is hasn't been reported until recently.\r\n\r\nLove that you've put together a patch for it! I would be happy to provide feedback.

Thanks for the report. Prioritizing as high.\n- I was trying to reproduce this earlier. I'm not sure if it's related but there also seems to be a behavior issue with the selection if you scroll down at least one line in something like `less`, then select at least two lines including the status line at the bottom, then scroll back up.\n- Further info: Tested on 0.2.0 with commit 1887722ef5b6ac1 (not tested without) and 0.2.1, both are affected. I've also added that you have to release the selection button to the repro steps.\n- Video of reproduction on my system [URL]\n- I have same issue, happened during text selection, but I'm not sure whether I was in less at the time.

I believe that nobody actually ever tested selection while scrolling, since it's a bit awkward to do with a mouse.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems like the selection only updates during mouse movement, not when scrolling.

Fiddling with text selection in chrome, I see similar behaviour where it only includes the character beneath the cursor if more than half of it is selected. This logically makes sense; however, in practice, alacritty is consistently failing to select as expected.\r\n\r\nThough I am now noticing another issue that may be the root cause of this. The start of the selection does not seem to be tied to where the mouse down event happened. You can click on a cell, wait, and then move the mouse quickly to start selecting and if you moved fast enough, the first cell of the selection will not be where you first clicked.\r\n\r\n[Image: alacritty_fast_selection]\n- I'm not able to reproduce this, could you provide some additional system information?\n- Hardware: Asus UX430UA\r\nOS: Arch Linux x64\r\nKernel: 4.13.12-1-ARCH\r\nGPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620\r\nGPU Driver: i915\r\nWindow Manager: I3\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any more specifics.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the next week I should be able to run some tests in more generic environments\n- I've tried this on a slower machine and there I'm able to reproduce this issue.

I can imagine that a configuration option could be introduced if someone is willing to do the work, but it's unlikely the default behavior is going to be changed. However the bug should definitely be fixed, so I'd use this issue to track the progress on fixing that bug. If you want to create a separate issue for tracking a configuration option for sub-cell selection start, feel free to do so. But it's probably going to be low priority, at least for me.\n- I have this issue on my laptops as well, and I can confirm that it also happens on the master branch. It should be noted that this issue doesn't seem to be caused by a selection starting just in the middle, you can drag your cursor over almost the whole letter and have it missed. Further, if you click, and very slowly drag after a short pause it works as intended pretty reliably.\n- @chrisduerr I use and discovered the issue on the scrollback branch so it is definitely present there too.\n- Thanks for looking into this! I'll take a peek at the code when I've got some time. Sounds like it's either a super simple fix or some really painful racing condition or something like that. :D\n- I've opened a PR which should fix this (#1389).

But I don't know when the regression happened...\r\n\r\nThis happens with `TERM` set to either alacritty or xterm\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- Is [Link: this] the previous issue you're talking about?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the space in the line above the bar is related, I don't see how that would affect things. However I'm unaware of how mocp draws things, so I'm not sure why this wouldn't work. A complete background change shouldn't be an issue and the escape sequence from the previous issue works just fine for me.\n- @chrisduerr nope, that was a separate issue. That still works as it should.\r\n\r\nEDIT: IIRC, the space was relevant as mocp would trigger an optimized redraw command when the progress bar reached that location.\n- The problem with an `optimized redraw command` is that it might not be 100% sound and cause issues with Alacritty, since some programs rely on slow drawing terminals or just partial damaging of the viewport instead of full redraws.\r\n\r\nWould be good to find an independent example to make it clear that this is actually an issue with Alacritty and not just `mocp` trying to use a 'hack' for redrawing faster which isn't guaranteed to work properly by the various terminal specifications.\n- I think was a simple term code that it used. It's using ncurses from drawing IIRC.\r\n\r\nIt there a way to see the term codes sent in a debug mode?\n- The command `alacritty -vv` will print all unhandled escape codes sent.\r\n\r\nTo print every escape code, you'd have to modify the code. However there will likely be A LOT of escape codes.\n- This works as it should in the 0.1.1 release. So this seems to be a regression. I'll try\n...[Middle Discussions Snipped]...\nit:** It seems that this escape looks similar to the issue, but comparing Alacritty to XTerm, Termite and URxvt here looks like Alacritty is doing everything correct.\n- I should note that this is a redraw issue. It renders fine at first. But some new draw commands seems to mess up the existing cells.\r\n\r\nI also noticed some problems in weechat where letters disappear from the input field if I move the text cursor over them. But I haven't checked if it is 0c3e286 that is the cause for this too yet...\n- I have never encountered anything like that in weechat and I'm using that on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAre you running these inside of tmux?\n- No, I'm running it without tmux/screen.\r\n[Image: out]\r\n\r\n[Image: out2]\n- I can not reproduce this. Which shell are you running? Are you certain this is caused by the commit you've linked (do both these issues get fixed with the previous commit?)?\n- Yes both gets fixed if I revert the changes made to `src/term/mod.rs` in 0c3e286\n- I'm also affected by this in Emacs terminal mode and can confirm that reverting [Link: 0c3e286] resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are exactly the same as the animated GIFs as shown in [Link: the comment above]: when moving the cursor to the right, the character glyph under the previous position randomly vanishes.\r\n\r\n(BTW, reverting has a minor conflict because of some refactor that has already happened in `src/renderer/mod.rs`.)\n- If it helps, my `TERM` is `xterm-24bits` whose terminfo definition came from this: [URL] ."}

Everything with respect to the keymap works great (as far as I can tell) except for Cmd-key combinations.  Here's what I'm seeing with `--print-events` when I type Cmd-v (which should paste, but instead just types 'v'):\r\n\r\n```\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Pressed, 55, Some(LWin), , None)\r\nglutin event: ReceivedCharacter('v')\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Pressed, 47, Some(Period), SUPER, Some(\"v\"))\r\nglutin event: Awakened\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Released, 47, Some(Period), SUPER, None)\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Released, 55, Some(LWin), , None)\r\n```\r\nPeriod on the QWERTY keyboard corresponds to \"v\" in Dvorak, so it seems as though for some reason, with the Cmd-key down, alacritty is getting the raw- not OS-remapped- key events? In the event in question, both `Some(Period)` and `Some(\"v\")` are in the event.\r\n\r\nAn awkward but effective workaround is to use these keybindings:\r\n```\r\n  - { key: I,        mods: Command, action: Copy                         }\r\n  - { key: Period,   mods: Command, action: Paste                        }\r\n  - { key: X,        mods: Command, action: Quit                         }\r\n```\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- Just want to add that Alacritty uses `Control-Shift-C` and `Control-Shift-V` for copy and paste out-of-the-box, so you can always just use these keyboard shortcuts instead.\n- I can confirm that this is happening for me on OSX (10.13.1) using Colemak instead of Qwerty. \r\n\r\nI added a custom keybinding to create new windows, as follows: \r\n```\r\n- { key: N,        mods: Command, command: { program: \"open\", args: [\"-n\", \"/Applications/Alacritty.app\"] } }\r\n```\r\nI thought that this simply wasn't working.  Then I hit `cmd+k` (which is normally `cmd+n` on a qwerty keyboard), and it popped open a new window.\n- See [URL] regarding the handling of dead keys which may or may not relate to this issue.

As an example of where this might happen, tdrop (which is a wrapper to run pr\n...[Middle Discussions Snipped]...\nnal size in cols/lines (e.g my preferred ratio of 90/27) it still resizes down.\r\nI suspect that the issue you were trying to address is a secondary one mentioned in a comment (resizing even if the size was already set by xdotool or similar), rather than the resizing on startup in general (the actual bug).\r\n\r\nThe original comment by @jwilm suggests that the issue is with lack of API support within glutin, but as per the two bugs above (tomaka/glutin#1096 and tomaka/winit#785) that's not apparently an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is stopping us from figuring out the font metrics before actually creating a window at this point?\r\nIf there is something, could the one with that knowledge also follow up in tomaka/winit#785?\n- If you set window dimensions and the DPI factor is not equal to 1, it's impossible not to resize at startup.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue is exactly what vberger has said in the winit issue. It's pointless that we're able to get the DPI for all displays when we do not know which display the window is going to be spawned on.\n- At this point, I think the question becomes \"how do other terminals handle it?\"\r\nI don't experience the same problems in, say, Konsole.\r\nAll of my displays (at least at home) have a non-1 DPI factor, but all of my displays per-system also have identical DPI factors (same-size displays with same resolution in all multi-display setups).\r\nSurely there's some way for alacritty to handle these common scenarios with equal grace to virtually every other alternative?"}

Does that PR fix the build issues for you?\n- Just verified it does not (it produces segfault, I posted stack trace in [Link: PR comment])\n- That backtrace is kinda surprising because it fails at the following code:\r\n```rust\r\n    let windowed_context = ContextBuilder::new()\r\n        .with_srgb(srgb)\r\n        .with_vsync(true)\r\n        .with_hardware_acceleration(None)\r\n        .build_windowed(window, event_loop)?;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is actually before any of Alacritty's OpenGL routines run.

Same with the columns.\n- ~~For me, it's off by 7(random number) in case I create underline on the last line.~~\r\n\r\nNevermind, `alacritty` was rendering debug output too fast (instant update) and the needed lines were sent out of scrollback buffer without noticeable screen update.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, seems like off-by-one.\r\n\r\nI think I can send a PR to fix this in an hour or less.\n- Just an update to the issue.\r\nThe issue is presented only with the last underline in the last line\r\n[Image: Screenshot_Tue 30 Jul 2019 11:58:34 PM MSK]\r\n\r\nThis is also presented when underlining on a prompt regardless of the position, but your cursor should be to the left to underlined text.

Interpreting them the same as the sequence without will create glitches and confuse applications. The same applies to the intermediates (` !\\\"#$%&'()*+,-./`).\r\n\r\nProperly ignoring unknown sequences is essential for the ongoing terminal ecosystem evolution as new sequences are allocated.\r\n\r\nThe current code in ansi.rs: `csi_dispatch` seems to get both these sequence parts in `intermediates` but mostly ignores them, except for select cases.\r\n\r\nThe following is based on information of the sequences interpreted by xterm, vte/gnome-terminal, konsole and rxvt-unicode. Also see my ongoing [Link: documentation project] for further details.\r\n\r\nI think for the currently implemented sequences the only ones that should trigger with an non empty `intermediates` are:\r\n* `J` and `K` for `intermediates` exactly `?`. Strictly this is for protected cells, but it's commonly implemented on terminals that don't actually implement protected cells (if protected cells are not supported it behaves like the non `?` version)\r\n* And of course `h` and `l` for `intermediates` exactly `?`. Similar to what alacritty currently does.\r\n* possibly `n` for `intermediates` exactly `?`. The expected behavior here is different from the not `?` versions and alacritty should either ignore them or properly implement this different behavior. alacritty currently only supports 5 and 6 so a proper implementation can just add a additional `?` in the output for the dec private variants.\r\n* `q` should set cursor style only when `intermediates` is exactly ` ` (space). Without it's a different sequence understood by xterm (and DEC compatible terminals; DECLL).\r\n\r\nCurrently i think the following claimed sequences are misinterpreted:\r\n```\nESC [ Ⓝ ␣ @  \tScroll Left\r\nESC [ Ⓝ ␣ A  \tScroll Right\r\nESC [ > Ⓝ T  \tUnset Title \n...[Description Truncated]...\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- Thanks for going into so much detail about the issue. It sounds like a very sane suggestion though I'd have to look into it myself to get a full grasp of the issue at hand.\n- Any news on this? Anything i can do to help this along?\n- While I think I understand the general situation, it's hard for me to judge what exactly needs to be done to resolve this.\r\n\r\nI'm also not aware of any serious bugs this *currently* causes in the wild.\r\n\r\nBecause of this other issues have had priority for now. The best way to help is obviously always to contribute, but I don't expect that from anyone. Other than that this will just have to wait until I can get around to it.\n- I don't have much clue about rust. So i'm reluctant to open a PR, because i expect whatever i come up would be highly unidiomatic. \r\n\r\nBasically csi_dispatch in ansi.rs would need to include `intermediates` in addition to `action` in the matching. With almost all matches only triggering if `intermediates` is empty.\r\n\r\nThe 'q' match would need to be modified to match on `action == 'q' && intermediates == [' ']`.\r\nThe matches for 'l' (reset mode) and 'h' (set mode) would need to work with both `intermediates == [Link: ]` and `intermediates == ['?']` but the modes are different namespaces (i.e. `\\e[12h` is [send receive mode] while `\\e[Link: ?12h` is [cursor blinking mode])\r\n\r\nI think alacritty might work with just those sequences. One step more would be to think about the other combination from my start post and thinking about what alacritty should respond to \"Secondary Device Attributes\" (`\\e[>c`).\r\n\r\nIf you want to see which sequences (`action` + `intermediates`) other terminals support the documentation for vte (gnome-terminal, etc) at [URL] is fairly complete (all toplevel CSI sequences are listed and most have a description).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help reviewing a possible PR for this, or course.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this currently causes bugs in the wild, i would expect software that does terminal identification based on responses to get confused by getting a \"Primary Device Attributes\" when asking for \"Secondary Device Attributes\". The library i'm working with certainly does."}

The main problem with this behavior is that it’s not documented in config file. This thing exist for achieving transparency in alt-screen apps like alsamixer/vim/mutt etc.\r\n\r\nIf you dont want this behavior just change background color a bit.\n- Ah, I'm used to urxvt, which does not do this.  I understand why this behavior exists; a program explicitly setting the background to the same as its default color probably has the intention of resetting the background.\r\n\r\nThe program I was using broke this assumption, since it intends to print arbitrary colors. [Link: `pixterm` is another program] which will have this issue; if an image is printed which happens to have a pixel match the background color, a noticeable hole will appear.\r\n\r\nI would like to disable this behavior for this reason, or even better change it so that only the 16-color black causes this. I'll try and patch this myself, so leave this issue closed unless someone else wants this behavior.\n- As I said, just slightly change your background color, you're already using opacity setting, so you shouldn't notice it. Otherwise you have to change how alacritty rendering works.\n- If I'm understanding you correctly, you're talking about something like setting `black: ' '` and `background: ' '`, right? That way `\\e[40m` will display in `#000020`, and not trigger the opacity setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis won't help if I want to use `pixterm` or a similar program.  If my background is ` `, then I'll see a hole whenever pixterm displays an image with `#000020`. If I slightly change it to ` `, then I'll see a hole whenever pixterm displays an image with `#00001F`.  I could view any image with any colors in pixterm, so any background will cause this papercut somewhere.\n- While setting the color to the background color should give transparency, specifying a truecolor should not cause any transparency. @kchibisov is already working on a patch to fix this, so hopefully we can get the best of both worlds here again (seems like there was a regression in  )."}

The idea behind this is that the user's binding will always work for all scopes he has defined, while default bindings are left untouched as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis already works well when staying either only in positive, or in negative modes, but as soon as modes are mixed like `Alt` and `~Alt` things get messed up. Overwriting a default binding by only overwriting the `~Alt` one for example, will currently also disable the `Alt` binding. This is inconsistent with what would be expected by the user, since he has only requested a change in Alacritty's behavior in this specific mode.\r\n\r\nI think to make sure that we do not create a regression in another area by fixing this, it's probably useful to lay out a table with all possible relevant combinations and creating dedicated tests for them to assure that the specification and implementation match up properly this time.\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- Here's a table of the currently intended overwriting behavior:\r\n\r\n**ALL:** All terminal modes.\r\n**A:** A terminal mode other than **B**.\r\n**B:** A terminal mode other than **A**.\r\n**~Y:** Mode **Y** not set.\r\n**X:** Replace binding.\r\n**0:** Keep binding.\r\n\r\n|         | ALL | A |  ~A | B |  ~B | A + B |  ~A + B |  A + ~B | ~A + ~B |\r\n|---------|-----|---|-----|---|-----|-------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n|     ALL |  X  | X |  X  | X |  X  |   X   |    X    |    X    |    X    |\r\n|       A |  X  | X |  0  | 0 |  0  |   X   |    0    |    X    |    0    |\r\n|      ~A |  X  | 0 |  X  | 0 |  0  |   0   |    X    |    0    |    X    |\r\n|       B |  X  | 0 |  0  | X |  0  |   X   |    X    |    0    |    0    |\r\n|      ~B |  X  | 0 |  0  | 0 |  X  |   0   |    0    |    X    |    X    |\r\n|  A +  B |  X  | X |  0  | X |  0  |   X   |    X    |    X    |    0    |\r\n| ~A +  B |  X  | 0 |  X  | X |  0  |   X   |    X    |    0    |    X    |\r\n|  A + ~B |  X  | X |  0  | 0 |  X  |   X   |    0    |    X    |    X    |\r\n| ~A + ~B |  X  | 0 |  X  | 0 |  X  |   0   |    X    |    X    |    X    |\r\n\r\nA short summary would be that a binding is removed, when either of the bindings contains any mode of the opposing binding."}

MacOS 10.13.3\r\nAlacritty version:  \r\n\r\nA focused alacritty terminal turns invisible when another app is opened. I'm using [Link: chunkwm] (a tiling window manager) so the alacritty terminal gets resized when I open another app. The contents of the alacritty terminal become visible when I focus the window again. I attached a gif showing this in action, the red outline shows which window has focus.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, this weird combination of a window being resized but losing focus that causes the terminal to stay invisible.\r\n\r\nThis is really just an annoyance :)\r\n\r\n[Image: alac]\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- Hmm If I had to guess the window probably isn't redrawn even though it should be.\r\n\r\nHowever there should be a redraw issued after resizing, not sure why it doesn't happen.

Any updates?\n- If you're interested in tracking progress, I'd recommend subscribing to the upstream issue.\r\n\r\nI'm struggling with this myself on macOS, however there's nothing Alacritty can do here. Once it's fixed upstream, it will be resolved in Alacritty within a short period of time.\n- It looks like that PR has been closed due to the creation of EventLoop 2.0. See [URL] for the new Event Loop system PR.\n- @alexmaras you can follow the work being done on the new event loop integration in #2438. I'd be curious to hear if this solves the issue @jwkvam described.\n- @nixpulvis `run_return` is steel not implemented in `winit` on macOs, so you can't run #2438 on macOs atm.

[Link: 0.3.0 RC3] works fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to spot test the commits between 0.3.0 RC3 and 0.3.0 and found that [Link: this commit to window.rs] caused it.\r\n\r\nEvery commit before then works fine when `decorations: none` is used.\r\n\r\nHope that helps you.\n- Could you try with #2438?\n- I got a runtime error trying to run that PR\r\n[Image: image]\r\n\r\nThis is what I ran to get that PR and build it:\r\n```\n[cygw alacritty]$ git fetch origin pull/2438/head:pr2438\r\nremote: Enumerating objects: 33, done.\r\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.\r\nremote: Total 62 (delta 32), reused 32 (delta 32), pack-reused 29\r\nUnpack\n...[Middle Discussions Snipped]...\ndead_code, but it compiled.  Running it didn't result in a runtime error, but the problem persists.\n- Since the glutin example was just a white window instead of the rectangle it is supposed to render, I've reported this problem upstream:\r\n\r\n[URL]\n- @JDTX This should have been fixed 4 days ago in winit, I'm not sure if the version you've tested already had that fix in or not.\r\n\r\nCould you test the #2438 PR again, I've bumped it again so the IME failure should not arise anymore and the latest winit version should be included. Would be much appreciated.\n- @chrisduerr I received a compilation error with the latest code from the PR.\r\n```\nwarning: unused imports: `SizeInfo`, `Term`\r\n  --> alacritty\\src\\window.rs:38:32\r\n   |\r\n38 | use alacritty_terminal::term::{SizeInfo, Term};\r\n   |                                ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^\r\n...

I ran these two commands against the PR to update them,\r\n```\r\nsed -i \"s/with_visibility/with_visible/g\" alacritty/src/window.rs\r\nsed -i \"s/with_transparency/with_transparent/g\" alacritty/src/window.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n@chrisduerr It built with the above changes, and it works now with decorations set to none!\r\n[Image: image]\n- Thanks for the help with testing, looks like this will get fixed as soon as the glutin Evlp2 PR is merged."}
{"project_id": "Alacritty", "bug_id": "99", "source_type": "github", "label": "Interface :: API Misuse (CWE-628)", "llm_input_text": "[Title]: Opacity setting not applied\n[Symptom]:\nWhich operating system does the issue occur on?\r\nLinux -- Ubuntu 19.04 dev\r\nIf on linux, are you using X11 or Wayland? X11\r\n\r\nThis issue might be more question on how to debug this rather than there is an actual issue. Recently I updated alacritty to the latest master ( ) and install using `cargo deb --install`. My opacity setting is no longer being applied. I have also recently gotten an external gpu and have been messing with the gpu drivers (switching between nvidia versions and nouveau) so I'm not necessarily convinced this is an issue with the latest Alacritty. When running under sway window manager the opacity works, but under gnome (3.32) on X11 the opacity setting does not. \r\n\r\nI have tried running alacritty with the `-vvv` option but haven't seen any errors or logs that seem relevant. I'm still learning about how all the pieces work together recently switching over from mac to linux so I'm not sure where to look next for why the opacity is not working.\n\n[Context/Logs]:\n- I'm not aware of an isuse with opacity on Linux. The only two things that are commonly issues with this is that people think it's a transparency (not opacity, which is the opposite) setting and that no compositor is running.\r\n\r\nI'd expect GNOME on X11 to be running a compositor by default, however making sure that compositing is working properly is probably your best bet.\r\n\r\nThere's likely no logging in Alacritty's output because Alacritty doesn't run into any issues. If Alacritty attempts to render a transparent window and there is no issue, but the window manager doesn't render it with transparency, there's little Alacritty can do since it doesn't know anything about that.\n- After updating alacritty I had similar issues, now transparency doesn't work. I am using xcompmgr as the compositor, and all the settings are the same than before updating alacritty.\n- I've verified myself with `compton` and i3 and I can not reproduce this issue. Transparency works as expected.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if a fully transparent window with `background_opacity: 0` will have a black background or if it will have the background set in the `colors` section?\n- I tried with compton just in case, and still transparency doesn't work on alacritty. When opacity is set to 0 it seems that alacritty only displays a black background\n- Update, I don't have this problem with version 0.2.9\n- Update2: Seems that the commit which introduced the problem was \"0f96a62\"\n- I am also experiencing this issue, after upgrading\n...[Middle Discussions Snipped]...\nWM. Maybe that can give us some hints.\r\n\r\nSince this was apparently caused by an upstream change, I've also reported the issue upstream here:\r\n[URL]\r\n\r\nIf anyone here is willing to bisect winit to check where this issue might be coming from, that would be very helpful. It might be a bit laborious but would hopefully give us a pretty good idea of what caused this. If someone is interested and needs help, please let me know. If someone found the bad commit, please report it to the upstream issue.\n- [Link: Here] is my glxinfo output\n- Same for me, with master it seems to work fine. I'm using Gentoo, Linux 5.0.5, nvidia, xcompmgr and dwm. Here is my glxinfo [URL]\n- Oh I totally misunderstood @FliiFe and thought he said master does **not** fix the issue, oops.\r\n\r\nLooks like the issue is resolved then.\n- Still cannot apply opacity since alacritty 0.3.0\r\nOS: Arch Linux \r\nWM: kwin5\r\nGPU driver: xf86-video-radeon\r\n\r\nTried both glutin 0.21.0-rc1 and 0.21.0-rc2 (changing `PossiblyCurrentContext` to `PossiblyCurrent`)\n- My glxinfo is pasted here: [URL]\n- I've reopened the upstream issue: [URL]\n- The same problem is also reproduced on my another PC with Intel integrated GPU.\r\nOS: Arch Linux\r\nWM & Compositor: kwin5\r\nMesa: 19.0.1-2\r\nGPU driver: modesetting DDX with i965 kernel driver\r\nglxinfo: [URL]\r\n\r\nOn this Intel machine, I did a git bisect on the commit history of alacritty. the last good commit (that can show transparency) is   and the first bad commit (that shows total opacity) is   ."}

When the pc suspends for just an hours, alacritty usually just takes a few minutes to redraw."}
