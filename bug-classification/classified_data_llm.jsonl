The architecture of this gem is quite clever and I like a lot about it, including the arbre library (which I would love to see extracted for use externally).

The master branch focus has some basic assumptions that don't yet allow for as much flexibility as my projects require, and I think there are still some critically hooks as well. I do expect that to improve, but, the layout issue still troubles me a lot and prevents me from confidently embracing it as a key component of my apps. So, I assume the present goals of the project are for it to be a sidelined admin interface.

This leads me to believe there is some kind of js code in the master branch that doesn't want to be nice to jQuery.\n\nDiscussion:\nHmm, will look into these issues\n---\nHey, Matt. The email and logout portion is still missing, but I got rid of the js error by running rails generate active_admin:assets as suggested by issue 309: https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/309. I would assume it was caused by my switch.\n---\nPlease run \"rails generate active_admin:assets\" and add the following to your config/intializers/active_admin.rb file: Let me know if these changes work for you.\n---\nI had just ran that when you posted. :P The config lines worked like a charm. (Did I just say that?) I figured there would be some changes to be made when switching. Hopefully this will help anyone else that might do the same.\n---\nI just updated the defaults so that they will work without adding these lines to the config file. I posted a brief outline of how to upgrade Active Admin on the mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/activeadmin/browse_thread/thread/4d860c8fe14006c6#"}

Exception Partial stacktrace The offending code appears to be in `lib/active_admin/comments/views/active_admin_comments.rb` This fixes the error\n\nDiscussion:\nHello, thanks for reporting this. The namespace name is stored as a symbol (https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/blob/master/lib/active_admin/namespace.rb#L35) So it looks like passing `where(:namespace => :admin)` generates the SQL `\"active_admin_comments\".\"namespace\" = \"active_admin_comments\".\"admin\"` instead of `\"active_admin_comments\".\"namespace\" = \"admin\"`. Is that the expected behaviour or a bug in the Postgresql adapter?\n---\nThis was reported before with rails 3.1 and mysql. https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/103 (See the comments) So I believe this is expected behavior.\n---\nWell, I discover something new in AR today! :)\n---\nTwo years later and this shitty bug show off again in master.\n---\nI'm facing the same issue, but with sqlite. Using a fresh rails app and and active_admin master branch, I get `SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: active_admin_comments.admin: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"active_admin_comments\" WHERE \"active_admin_comments\".\"namespace\" = \"active_admin_comments\".\"admin\"` when visiting the comments index action.\n---\n[This comment](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/103#issuecomment-1425822) is the topical one. It looks like certain DB adapters have this problem. What's weird, @marcusg, is that the Rails app that AA autobuilds for testing uses SQLite, but isn't running into this problem. That's an issue, because it means I can't reproduce it, so I can't be sure that any given change fixes it. Could you try changing this line?\n---\nCan you two try out #2310?\n---\n@Daxter: using your branch from PR https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/pull/2310 fixed the problem for me. Thanks!\n---\nCool. Once I get the failing test sorted, I'll merge the changes in.\n---\nOkay @marcusg, #2310 has been merged into master :]\n---\nVery nice, @Daxter. Thanks! :+1:"}
