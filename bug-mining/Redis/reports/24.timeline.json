comments:\n1. There is no leak on line 4639, just because when KEYS is given, no other arguments are parsed, all the rest is considered to be key names. However that's not the case for the other points where there is an actual leak. All instances of the leak fixed.\n2. The `newargv` leaks should be only on socket errors apparently (as you noted in your comment), since it's otherwise freed by passing the pointer to `replaceClientCommandVector` that takes ownership, or it gets freed. Fixed as well. Now the variable is declared at the top of the function and immediately initialized to NULL so that freeing it if not allocated is not an issue anyway.\n3. About the command retry, it was a totally mess, one of the worse pieces of code I ever wrote...

A key idea of the fix is that now the command can be retried only if we did not processed any reply, and the socket error happens ASAP. This is ok since we want to just trap sockets that generate errors because they timed-out. The retry code is basically not there to retry errors in the middle of the handshake, the command can be retried as a whole by the client in this case. However without the retry, a lot of avoidable socket errors are displayed to the user.\n2. The variable is now called `may_retry` to make it more explicit what we do.\n3. On socket errors that will be retried, we detect it ASAP and ship the command rewriting completely.\n4. If we received a different error while parsing the replies from the other server, socket errors are not reported, we already have a pending error to report, and it looks like it makes sense to report what we already got.\n5. On retry it's possible/ok that we get errors since the target key is busy, this should be handled by the client and is basically not different to what used to happen with a single key.\n6.

Probably the preallocation is a bit dumb, I changed the code to allocate it only when really needed so that we have to deal with less errors and we can just `return` in all parsing errors.\n\nAbout the fact we don't closed the socket on mixer errors, it's not a problem per se because when this happens it's safe to retry the same socket in the next call. However I find it not great that the same error is handled in slightly different ways depending on the details, so I'm going to add the call even when the socket error is not handled explicitly.\n\nI

again, I did an auditing of the new function, I can't find other errors, but modified the code a bit more in order to handle the cleanup of `newargv` in a single place.\n\nIt looks like a trivial way to simplify the function a lot more is to write it as a non retrying version, and wrap it into another function that will retry depending on the returned error. Probably not worth it right now since this is going to be back ported in all the production versions of Redis, and new code is always dangerous... :-)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/172779617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/173015889","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/3016#issuecomment-173015889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/3016","id":173015889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzAxNTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"kevinmcgehee","id":7883533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODM1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7883533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmcgehee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmcgehee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T23:00:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T23:00:34Z","body":"It looks good to me now.
