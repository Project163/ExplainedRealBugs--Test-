the core is big news! Thanks. No macros to walk the ziplist unfortunately, you may use RESTORE (but you have to fake the CRC64 checksum) in order to re-create the value into a live instance, btw if you can send me an hex-dump of the ziplist I'll happily check the format.\n\nAnother option is to take the hexdump, write a small C program to inject it inside an array of bytes, and then directly use the ziplist API to walk values.\n\nBtw this is a big step forward! Only problem I think we'll have is that we'll need to understand after we get what value is duplicated how it ended there, but should be simple to reproduce once we have the duplicated value.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/6308779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
