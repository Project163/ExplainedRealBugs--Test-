my first hypothesis that I'll verify in depth today is that `CLUSTER FORGET` may leave nodes with `node->slaveof` set to a node which is now deleted. Maybe this only happens only after node switches from master to slave or maybe it may happen always (need to check the code).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/171570077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/171575373","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/3002#issuecomment-171575373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/3002","id":171575373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTU3NTM3Mw==","user":{"login":"JackyWoo","id":3991709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTE3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3991709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo","html_url":"https://github.com/JackyWoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackyWoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T08:54:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T08:54:47Z","body":"I

Master A turns into slave.\n2. Some other node X is notified of the switch.\n3. When X updates the node A to turn it into a slave, it just calls `clusterNodeResetSlaves()`. The function does not care about setting all the slaves `slaveof` field to NULL.\n4. Later X is reached by `CLUSTER FORGET A`, so A no longer exists in X memory, but still it got other nodes pointing to its address in `slaveof`.\n5. X receives change of master info for some slave which used to have A as master. When this happens, we access a `slaveof` pointer which is invalid.\n\nThere are two fixes, one is conservative, one is more \"correct\" but more fragile.\n1. Conservative fix: when freeClusterNode() is called, instead of just freeing what appears to be in the `node->slaves` list, we scan all the nodes, and set any `node->slaveof` field set to the node we are freeing, to NULL.\n2. Correct minimal fix: just make sure that clusterNodeResetSlaves() sets slaves to NULL.\n\nI like more `2` because if there are more bugs we'll find it, but does a work proportional to the slaves for this past master, and not proportional to the number of nodes. Fixing it in a second and closing the issue. **Thanks for your help!** Please report more bugs.\n\nAgain:\n\n## Thanks!
