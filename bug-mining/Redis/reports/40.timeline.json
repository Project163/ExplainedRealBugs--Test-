fixed in all the branches. I think the bug is exploitable, because you can basically write the address of a Cluster node structure everywhere in the process memory. So the attacker may:\r\n\r\n1. Modify the nodes.conf so that a node is loaded with the ID containing actually a sequence which is executable.\r\n2. Being the node ID almost the first field of the structure (the second actually), we could set the address in a place (like a function pointer) so that the execution of the program will jump there.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that there is the `ctime` field as the first member of the structure, so there are 8 initial bytes the user cannot completely control, however probably there is some way to still exploit the bug, for instance by also using the other `clusterAddSlot()` call to selectively alter the last byte bits of the return address or alike. Did not investigate very carefully but in general it looks exploitable with efforts.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/340699388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
