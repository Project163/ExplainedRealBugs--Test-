This way the user may think everything is ok but actually no persistence at all is performed by the server: when the server goes down no data wil be available at all.\n\nEither Redis should abort when this happens or should return an error to every client trying to write against the server if Redis was not able to persist the latest time it tried. The error will no longer be reported once a successful BGSAVE/SAVE is performed.
