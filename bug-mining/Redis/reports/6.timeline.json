implemented.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/2212018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3647192,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY0NzE5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/3647192","actor":{"login":"libo","id":37512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo","html_url":"https://github.com/libo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-09-27T15:19:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/2212137","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/90#issuecomment-2212137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/90","id":2212137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTIxMzc=","user":{"login":"mrb","id":2878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb","html_url":"https://github.com/mrb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-09-27T15:28:23Z","updated_at":"2011-09-27T15:28:23Z","body":"@antirez

Redis should save a snapshot because N changes were made in the last M minutes, this status is only cleared when the background save succeeds. If it is not possible to create the snapshot (e.g. working directory has disappeared, so the file cannot be created), Redis continually retries a background save. A fork is made every time an attempt to create a background save is done, so when it immediately quits because of this error condition, Redis continually forks+retries.\n\nIt is an exceptional condition, but maybe we should degrade a little more graceful. Another option is of course to exit altogether when saving is not possible. An argument for this resolution could be that once a user configures saving, Redis shouldn't continue to run when this is no longer possible.\n\nWe should discuss this a little bit before continuing; users may depend on the fact that Redis doesn't exit when saving is not (or no longer) possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/2601241","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/90#issuecomment-2601241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/90","id":2601241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDEyNDE=","user":{"login":"richardbarran","id":94111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran","html_url":"https://github.com/richardbarran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbarran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-11-02T09:34:23Z","updated_at":"2011-11-02T09:34:23Z","body":"Just
