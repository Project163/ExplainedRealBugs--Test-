everybody,\r\n\r\nI am working for the Wikimedia foundation and we are happy users of Redis (Debian Jessie version, 2.8.17). We use Redis as queueing system for all the Mediawiki async jobs, that gets pushed via application servers and executed later on by special workers called jobrunners. These jobs can be moved in various queues (implemented as Lists) and we leverage the atomicity of the LUA scripts execution to make change safely without risking inconsistent views from the clients. Those scripts are sometimes big and heavy (some examples in [1] and [2]) and they use various kind of constructs that can generate race conditions (like `if`). We are aware of the fact that we are probably misusing all the Redis power, but it has been working fine until we discovered a long standing weird inconsistency in our slaves.\r\n\r\nOur architecture is the following: each Redis master has two slaves, one in the same datacenter and the other one in a different one (~40ms lag using ping). We discovered that the two slaves have different values for some key data structures, like some job queues/lists, but the interesting part is that the slave on the same datacenter is in sync with the master, meanwhile the one in the other datacenter shows huge differences.\r\n\r\nWe added a daily restart for all the Redis slaves to force sync with the master, and we found out that the slave in the other DC gets out of sync quickly (1 or 2 hours maximum). \r\n\r\nWe checked several bugs that might be related but none of them seems to fit completely:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/187\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/614\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/558\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2999\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/1525\r\n\r\nWe thought in the beginning that it was related to expiring TTLs for particular keys, but we are reasonably sure that they should not be the root cause of this problem because the data-structures that fall out of sync are not related.\r\n\r\nThese are the result of `INFO REPLICATION` for the master and two slaves:\r\n\r\nMaster\r\n```\r\n# Replication\r\nrole:master\r\nconnected_slaves:2\r\nslave0:ip=10.192.16.122,port=6380,state=online,offset=1085882179818,lag=0\r\nslave1:ip=10.64.16.183,port=6380,state=online,offset=1085883228241,lag=0\r\nmaster_repl_offset:1085882237236\r\nrepl_backlog_active:1\r\nrepl_backlog_size:1048576\r\nrepl_backlog_first_byte_offset:1085881188661\r\nrepl_backlog_histlen:1048576\r\n\r\n# Keyspace\r\ndb0:keys=9143109,expires=4438000,avg_ttl=1469527137\r\n```\r\n\r\nSlave in the same DC of the master:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Replication\r\nrole:slave\r\nmaster_host:10.64.0.201\r\nmaster_port:6380\r\nmaster_link_status:up\r\nmaster_last_io_seconds_ago:0\r\nmaster_sync_in_progress:0\r\nslave_repl_offset:1085919408979\r\nslave_priority:100\r\nslave_read_only:0\r\nconnected_slaves:0\r\nmaster_repl_offset:0\r\nrepl_backlog_active:0\r\nrepl_backlog_size:1048576\r\nrepl_backlog_first_byte_offset:0\r\nrepl_backlog_histlen:0\r\n\r\n# Keyspace\r\ndb0:keys=9128164,expires=4423075,avg_ttl=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSlave in a different DC (this slave also is replicated to another slave in the same DC, tried to remove it but I didn't observe any relevant change):\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Replication\r\nrole:slave\r\nmaster_host:10.64.0.201\r\nmaster_port:6380\r\nmaster_link_status:up\r\nmaster_last_io_seconds_ago:0\r\nmaster_sync_in_progress:0\r\nslave_repl_offset:1085876438756\r\nslave_priority:100\r\nslave_read_only:0\r\nconnected_slaves:1\r\nslave0:ip=10.192.16.123,port=6380,state=online,offset=3265663434,lag=1\r\nmaster_repl_offset:3265691776\r\nrepl_backlog_active:1\r\nrepl_backlog_size:1048576\r\nrepl_backlog_first_byte_offset:3264643201\r\nrepl_backlog_histlen:1048576\r\n\r\n# Keyspace\r\ndb0:keys=9128163,expires=4423109,avg_ttl=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we can't easily replicate these settings elsewhere we have not had the opportunity to test a new Redis version and observe the differences. I checked the changelog for 2.8 to 3.0 and I can see tons of changes to the Replication logic, but I didn't find anything related to this particular case so I am wondering if you could point me to the right direction to figure out the origin of this inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nLuca\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/blob/master/includes/jobqueue/JobQueueRedis.php (scripts marked by \"<<<LUA\")\r\n[2]: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-jobrunner/blob/master/redisJobChronService#L354","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/4103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/4103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18844707669,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs4AW6RwzwAAAARjO2tV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/18844707669","actor":{"login":"sundb","id":965798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb","html_url":"https://github.com/sundb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e4c1f6d45af9c9a51177483c4be7537d832903c0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sundb/redis/commits/e4c1f6d45af9c9a51177483c4be7537d832903c0","created_at":"2025-07-28T03:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18844707723,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs4AW6RwzwAAAARjO2uL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/18844707723","actor":{"login":"sundb","id":965798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb","html_url":"https://github.com/sundb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0cc16d0298995ae4292b0d317e17fa82c338942a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sundb/redis/commits/0cc16d0298995ae4292b0d317e17fa82c338942a","created_at":"2025-07-28T03:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20313772169,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs4AW6RwzwAAAAS6y5CJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/20313772169","actor":{"login":"minchopaskal","id":7338971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzg5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7338971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal","html_url":"https://github.com/minchopaskal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minchopaskal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"36a657b06a1fd34c8abaae9d18b46bc1a081d59a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minchopaskal/redis/commits/36a657b06a1fd34c8abaae9d18b46bc1a081d59a","created_at":"2025-10-16T09:14:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
