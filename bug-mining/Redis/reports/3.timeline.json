From the stack trace I believe there is some kind of HA daemon issuing \"SLAVE OF NONE\" to your slave instances when the master is unavailable, is it possible?\nI see this from this line:\n\n[2710] 17 Oct 16:56:25 \\* MASTER MODE enabled (user request)\n\nAt the same time however this instance got a request for another slave to use it as master (however this is unrelated to the bug perhaps, need to check this better).\n\nSo there is a bug for sure, but it is not on slave reconnection. Apparently the bug happens once the slave is elected to master. It still tries to reconnect via non blocking connect.\n\nThis is a big bug I'm glad you found it.

Jan, I was not able to reproduce the issue, but following the logic of what happened I think I fixed the issue in commit \"98f5abb\".\n\nWhat was happening is that the event to connect with the master in a non blocking way fired _after_ we already switched the instance into a slave. That even failed to accomplish its work, but as a side effect turned again the replication status into \"connecting\". So at the next cron loop the instance tried again to connect with the master. Since the instance is not a slave now the master host filed was set to NULL, causing a crash.\n\nPlease could you verify that latest commit in 2.4 branch fixes it?\n\nThanks again as only the detailed description made this fix easy (assuming it's fixed ;) since I was not able to reproduce.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/2439541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4334741,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzMzQ3NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/4334741","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"76e772f39a971e14e9c8cd077b68ad8ed8cc7f97","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/commits/76e772f39a971e14e9c8cd077b68ad8ed8cc7f97","created_at":"2011-10-18T09:15:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/2442444","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/145#issuecomment-2442444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/145","id":2442444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDI0NDQ=","user":{"login":"janoberst","id":19206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst","html_url":"https://github.com/janoberst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janoberst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-10-18T14:37:10Z","updated_at":"2011-10-18T14:37:10Z","body":"Hi Salvatore,\n\nThank you so much for getting to this so quickly. Your change definitely fixed the server crash. I re-ran my test twice and both times all 48 redis processes survived. Awesome.\n\nBut maybe this just made way for us to see the actual problem. Here's this morning's log. 10.235.27.6 is my Daemon, all the other IPs have changed, too. But the setup is the same. B is 10.230.31.186:10005, and C is 10.230.17.150:10010.\n\nInstance C is still trying to become slave of instance B, but doesn't succeed because of \"Error allocating resoures for the client\". This is a rather big DB with around 400MB, but the same things happen at around 40MB, too. The objects are seriously huge at around 1MB per object. Maybe that has something to do with it? If you want to, I can share the dataset with you, it's just random strings, lists, sets, sorted sets and hashes of 1MB length. The error never occurred on datasets with smaller objects.\n\nAfter sending \"SLAVE OF NO ONE\" to B and setting up C as slave of B, here's the log of B:\n\n```\n[2786] 18 Oct 14:18:17 - Accepted

Jan, thanks for the quick reply!\n\nThe problem we have here is apparently not related to our previous problem, and it is a bit strange, as this error message can only be the result of the following lines of code failing:\n\n```\n    if (aeCreateFileEvent(server.el,fd,AE_READABLE,\n        readQueryFromClient, c) == AE_ERR)\n    {\n        close(fd);\n        zfree(c);\n        return NULL;\n    }\n```\n\nit is not possible it's an out of memory so the only possibility is that we fail trying to register the event in the epool interface.\n\nSo I'm already in need for more debugging / information, specifically the INFO output of the instance logging \"# Error allocating resoures for the client\" can be helpful, and even more, and \"strace -p <pid>\" trace while the instance is
