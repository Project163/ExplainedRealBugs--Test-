Similarly I guess that every command in the command table should have an additional entry, that is the bulk representation of this command name. This way we can also void creating the name of the command as a string object all the times.\n\nAbout sharing output buffer between slaves, something to take in mind but sounds like a possible premature optimization right now, because _when things work well_ objects are discarded ASAP, and if we have shared objects for the different parts of the protocol, and for command names, we end with everything shared anyway (but not the list nodes itself of course).\n\nAbout the last commit and freeMemoryIfNeeded(), in that specific case shared objects are already helping I think, because this is exactly an instance of when many objects are queued into client->reply, so avoiding having many copies is reducing a bit memory pressure, but of course not enough to fix our problem alone.\n\nThe good thing is that I tried to stress test this patch with multiple slaves even synching at the same time, with AOF enabled on master, and so forth, and everything seems to work well.\n\nThanks for the comments / review!\n\nCheers,\nSalvatore\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3832565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3832774","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/327#issuecomment-3832774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/327","id":3832774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzI3NzQ=","user":{"login":"pietern","id":9845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern","html_url":"https://github.com/pietern","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietern/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-06T17:27:41Z","updated_at":"2012-02-06T17:27:41Z","body":"Even when the buffer needs to resort to the `client->reply` list objects are coalesced. This is the in-place gluing of output buffers introduced in 2.2 (I believe). Even when objects are created when needed, they are either freed before control returns to `freeMemoryIfNeeded` because they have been glued to the tail string object, or are used as new tail string object (and are not freed). When the objects are shared, and they become the new tail string object, they are dup'ed when the networking code tries to glue more data.\n\nI think that your patch only works because `freeMemoryIfNeeded` explicitly flushes to slaves as needed. I think this could work as a stop-gap, but is definitely not an ideal solution. When a system is under pressure, this makes Redis perform blocking I/O pretty often (reducing the available throughput).

points Pieter, I'll try to write what I understand about this matter currently:\n- reply_bytes is flawed as you say, since it does return the true count of bytes used for the output buffers. It was not a problem initially, it was designed to have a limit in output buffers, and this limit doesn't need to be too much precise, but now the issue is, we are used reply_bytes in a different context where it is interesting to have a more precise variant.\n- reply_bytes is wrong in two ways: it overstimates when objects are shared. It understimates space needed for sds strings because it considers their length instead of the actual allocated bytes.\n\nNow a few remarks about the above two points.\n- what reply_bytes should hold to be precise? The amount of memory used for output buffers in a metric compatible with zmalloc_used_memory(). In theory we should use the same rounding / system to estimate allocations as used inside zmalloc.c, that is asking the allocator or approximating when the allocator does not have the capability.\n- How bad is the overestimation? Not very bad because we glue strings so in the long run if output buffer size is non trivial it is very likely that we mostly have objects that are not shared. However if many objects in the output list are REDIS_REPLY_CHUNK_BYTES in size, and are shared, then the overestimation can be much more sensible.\n- How bad is the underestimation? Pretty bad because objects are created by appending into them when we glue, using sdscatlen(), so the difference between the string length of the sds, and the actual room used, can be sensible. Also we are currently not taking into account the size of the sds header itself. The best solution as you said would be to query the allocator here.\n\nSo, it seems like, we could completely kill underestimation in favor of overestimation, and still overestimation would occur rarely, mostly when we have legitimate objects from GETs or other commands that are bigger than REDIS_REPLY_CHUNK_BYTES and are shared. (But when this happens it can get very bad).\n\nSo, let's check what happens when we overestimate and when we underestimate the buffers used by slaves in the context of maxmemory.\n- overestimation: we subtract more memory from used_memory, so the system starts evicting keys later, and the more output buffers we have, the more the system thinks he actually has space available!\n- underestimation: the system thinks more memory is used compared to what is actually used, and may start evicting more keys than needed.\n\nBoth ways it is not very cool...\n\nAnother thing, currently getClientOutputBufferMemoryUsage does not consider that every list item is also an object, so we should at least add sizeof(robj*) for coherence.\n\nI think we need definitely to think better about this :) Maybe the solution of subtracting the output buffer may be avoided in favor of something better?\n\nAt this point I'm not ready to merge this stuff into even unstable. Maybe it's the best we can do, maybe we can do better than this even without making the implementation more complex than that.\n\nThanks for the brainstorming!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3837457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9113175,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkxMTMxNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/9113175","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"442246dde2d8842caf4c1f4d4694ef5a78a0bad8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/commits/442246dde2d8842caf4c1f4d4694ef5a78a0bad8","created_at":"2012-02-07T12:05:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3851465","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/327#issuecomment-3851465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/327","id":3851465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTE0NjU=","user":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-07T16:51:03Z","updated_at":"2012-02-07T16:52:47Z","body":"@pietern in commit 609baba8a2d115f05e8fbc0db742ca60848e3c80 after implementing the fixes we discussed the memory estimation is incredibly precise, at the point that I can stop the slaves for a lot of time and used_mem - used_obuf_mem remains constant (with a few bytes errors) so that the subtracted memory seems exactly the additional memory allocated.\n\nNow the patch is working better and there is no key expiration when slaves are blocked, but now my concern is about the _semantics_ of this patch.
