#14218\r\n\r\nBefore, we replicate HINCRBYFLOAT as an HSET command with the final value in order to make sure that differences in float precision or formatting will not create differences in replicas or after an AOF restart.\r\nHowever, on the replica side, if the field has an expiration time, HSET will remove it, even though the master retains it. This leads to inconsistencies between the master and the replica.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we now use the HSETEX command with the KEEPTTL flag instead of HSET, ensuring that the field’s TTL is preserved.\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in version 7.4, but the HSETEX command was only implemented from version 8.0. Therefore, this patch does not fix the issue in the 7.4 branch, a separate commit is needed to address it in 7.4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/14224/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/14224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3125769354","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/14218#issuecomment-3125769354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/14218","id":3125769354,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJhcs66T3SK","user":{"login":"ShooterIT","id":18362176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzYyMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18362176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT","html_url":"https://github.com/ShooterIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T06:46:59Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T06:46:59Z","body":"OK, let's fix for 8.0+ first","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3125769354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ShooterIT","id":18362176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzYyMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18362176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT","html_url":"https://github.com/ShooterIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShooterIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/3125866145","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/14218#issuecomment-3125866145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/14218","id":3125866145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJhcs66UO6h","user":{"login":"tezc","id":17865367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY1MzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17865367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc","html_url":"https://github.com/tezc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tezc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T07:17:41Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T07:17:41Z","body":"can't we replicate as multiple commands inside MULTI for 7.4?
