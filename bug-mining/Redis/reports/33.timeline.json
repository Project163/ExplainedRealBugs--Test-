a very interesting finding @soloestoy! I never thought that string objects could be reclaimed in the background, because normally UNLINK will never do that since for non-aggregate objects, the deletion actually happens synchronously (because of the deallcation effort being 1). However as you noted FLUSHALL ASYNC changes the game here... Your fix seems sensible to me, but now what I'm worried about, is if there are other places where the object can end being shared. The client `argv` vector should be safe since, as soon as the command is executed and the object shared, the client argument vectors gets reset before any other client could call FLUSHALL. Did you tried to analyze other scenarios where this could happen?

@antirez \r\n\r\nWe have talked about lazyfree's memory leak problem in issue #4323 , and already fixed a bug about `FLUSHALL ASYNC` and `SLOWLOG`, but now I find another problem...about `lazyfree-lazy-server-del`.\r\n\r\nThe `lazyfree-lazy-server-del` works in `rename` and `move` command, more accurately it's in `dbDelete()`\r\n```\r\nint dbDelete(redisDb *db, robj *key) {\r\n    return server.lazyfree_lazy_server_del ? dbAsyncDelete(db,key) :\r\n                                             dbSyncDelete(db,key);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake `move` command as an example:\r\n```\r\nvoid moveCommand(client *c) {\r\n...\r\n    o = lookupKeyWrite(c->db,c->argv[1]);\r\n...\r\n    incrRefCount(o);\r\n\r\n    /* OK! key moved, free the entry in the source DB */\r\n    dbDelete(src,c->argv[1]);\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the codes above, `o` is the source object, we call `incrRefCount` to increase `o->refcount`, after that and before lazyfree works `o->refcount` is 2...that is the problem which means that we create a race about the shared object, and may result in memory leak.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the memory leak, please check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/4601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/4601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/671816427","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/4323#issuecomment-671816427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/4323","id":671816427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTgxNjQyNw==","user":{"login":"soloestoy","id":24804835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODA0ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24804835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy","html_url":"https://github.com/soloestoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soloestoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T08:45:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T08:45:21Z","body":"solved
