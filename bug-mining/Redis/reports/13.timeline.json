you for your help. I think the next steps are the following:\n\n1) Please can you send me a core dump (and redis executable used)? We have instructions here: http://redis.io/topics/debugging\n\n2) It is very very unlikely this is the case since it seems a legitimate bug, but may you try ./redis-server --test-memory to check if everything is ok in the box?\n\nBtw with the core it will be much easier to debug what's happening because I'll be able to inspect the state of the program when crashing. Likely server.lua_caller is NULL.\n\nThank you!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/5365090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14298489,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0Mjk4NDg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/14298489","actor":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0ad10db22098ef1555236719743e02da7cb85e00","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/commits/0ad10db22098ef1555236719743e02da7cb85e00","created_at":"2012-04-27T09:46:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/5378196","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/480#issuecomment-5378196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/480","id":5378196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzgxOTY=","user":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-04-27T09:46:46Z","updated_at":"2012-04-27T09:46:46Z","body":"Issue fixed, what I was really needing was 8 hours of sleep and not a core ;) From the stack trace it is quite clear what's happening.
