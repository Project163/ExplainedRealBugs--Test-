a input element like `<input type=\"file\" webkitdirectory=\"\" multiple=\"\" name=\"files[]\" id=\"files\"\">` which prompts a user to select a folder. I need to get file names & paths of all the files within that folder.\r\n    \r\n    var input = document.getElementById('files');\r\n    input.onchange = function(e) {\r\n        var files = e.target.files; // File list\r\n        for (var i = 0; i < files.length; ++i) {\r\n          \r\n          var fpath = files[i].webkitRelativePath;\r\n          var ftype = files[i].type;\r\n          var fsize = files[i].size;\r\n          \r\n          console.log(fname)\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly fine when run from chrome web browser as shown here: https://jsfiddle.net/7prshjfz/. However, when I try to run the same app via electron it gives ONLY the folder name and nothing else. When I tried to debug further, I released that when a folder is selected, only the folder name, size, modified etc details are available.\r\n\r\nTherefore, clearly there is a different implementation of `webkitdirectory` in electron.  Is this an intended implementation?\r\n\r\n**My Problem:** I know I can use the `dialog.showOpenDialog` and read the `fs` using the directory path. But, I find this to be a bad solution for my case (or perhaps for anyone) because, I want my code to be minimal for the sake of the web app. I want to reuse as much of the functionality from the webapp with additional implementation in Electron and NodeJS. I would be grateful to know if there is any special implementation of webkitdirectory that works BOTH in an Internet Browser and Electron app with minimal modifications, for instance, to the above displayed code/ jsFiddle.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure If  I this is a missing feature/ bug or neither. Any feedback will be appreciated :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/9002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/9002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/332237394","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/839#issuecomment-332237394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/839","id":332237394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjIzNzM5NA==","user":{"login":"filipe-nunes","id":7281070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODEwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7281070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes","html_url":"https://github.com/filipe-nunes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T15:32:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T15:32:06Z","body":"+1 - only one file in the htmlElement.files and it only brings its basic info...","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/332237394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"filipe-nunes","id":7281070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODEwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7281070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes","html_url":"https://github.com/filipe-nunes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filipe-nunes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/349464639","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/839#issuecomment-349464639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/839","id":349464639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTQ2NDYzOQ==","user":{"login":"camow7","id":9794797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTQ3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9794797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7","html_url":"https://github.com/camow7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camow7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-05T22:35:38Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T22:35:38Z","body":"+1 I'm seeing this as well.
