And no hint of errors.\r\n\r\n## **Cause**\r\n\r\nFinally, I've found out why:\r\n\r\nI copied files of an old app folder of mine to start a new one.\r\nI edited \"package.json\", and tried to give the new app a different `\"productName\"`.\r\nHowever, I was distracted before I could make up my mind, and as a result, I mistakenly left the name with **an tailing whitespace**.\r\n\r\n## **To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. In \"package.json\", add a tailing whitespace to the value of `\"productName\"`.\r\n    For example, `\"My App \"`.\r\n2. Run Electron for this app.\r\n3. Go to the AppData folder \"C:\\Users\\{Your User Name}\\AppData\\Roaming\" (or, press `Win+R` and enter `%AppData%`)\r\n4. You will see the data folder for this app, but its name doesn't have that whitespace.\r\n    For example, \"My App\".\r\n5. In Electron, do anything with settings of DevTools, or set item of `localStorage`.\r\n6. Restart Electron and you will find all changes above are lost.\r\n7. And the data folder (\"My App\") will always be empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Suggestion**\r\n\r\nAutomatically trim it when the value of `\"productName\"` is read by Electron.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
