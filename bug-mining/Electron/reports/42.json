Electron version: 1.7.8 - 2.0.0 beta 4\r\n* Operating system: Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the 'default output' for the OS is removed, electron should fall back to some other device, and the audio stream for the input device should not be corrupted.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRemoving the 'default' output device corrupts the audio of the app.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/AGiantSquid/electron-quick-start.git\r\ncd electron-quick-start/\r\nyarn / npm install\r\nyarn start / npm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart with a computer with Windows installed. The bug will be easiest to see with at least 2 devices attached. In your Windows settings, check which audio device is set to 'default' for output. Your default for input does not matter.\r\n\r\nStart up electron like normal. When you talk into your mic, you should see the number 0 on the screen become some higher number corresponding to how loud you are talking. You should also hear yourself from the 'default' audio device. \r\n\r\nNow, remove the device that is set to 'default' for output on your os. You will see that the number reflecting your volume freezes and the audio stops. It becomes impossible to recover the audio connection for the duration of the session.\r\n\r\nThis is not normal. If you open index.html in Chrome, you will see that it will fall back to another device and your stream will continue, uninterrupted.","closed_by":{"login":"sofianguy","id":2138661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2138661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy","html_url":"https://github.com/sofianguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/12311/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/12311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
