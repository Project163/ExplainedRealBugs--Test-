The root of the issue in implementation of https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/176a76217c5f70d92bf21f6782a0c838a1e5058e/lib/common/parse-features-string.js\r\n\r\n1. For example if a webview is declared as:\r\n```html\r\n<webview src=\"view.html\" webpreferences = \" nodeIntegration =no, javascript =no\"></webview>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDespite it looks like `nodeIntegration` is disabled for the view, it is not, because a white space symbol before `nodeIntegration`.\r\n\r\nHowever it is silently broken only for the first item in comma separated list. In the example below `nodeIntegration` is disabled no matter how many spaces are between the name:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<webview src=\"view.html\" webpreferences=\"javascript =no,   nodeIntegration =no\"></webview>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. While for Boolean settings possible values are only `1`, `0`, `yes` or `no` there is no [warning](https://electronjs.org/docs/all#electron-security-warnings) or secure fallback if it fails to parse the value:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<webview src=\"view.html\" webpreferences=\"nodeIntegration = no\"></webview>\r\n```\r\n`nodeIntegration` won't be set neither to `true` nor `false`, but will be silently set to \" no\" and the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the code that reads and compares the value I didn't investigate.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nWhile a non-working setting can be easily detected during development if it is meant to enable some feature, a non-working security related setting that was meant to \"sandbox\" the view like `nodeIntegration=no` may slip unnoticed.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nornagon","id":172800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon","html_url":"https://github.com/nornagon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15594/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
