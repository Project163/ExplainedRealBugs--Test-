looks like the same issue, but when I try to run this code on 1.7.x line, everything performs as expected.  It's only when you move to 1.8 that things stop being sent.\r\n\r\nI created a repo that has similar code to the gist above: https://github.com/pcad/electron-ipc-test\r\n\r\nCommit 98be5386 uses electron 1.7.15\r\nCommit 70af35f83 uses electron 1.8.2\r\n\r\nIn 1.7 the message is passed through correctly.\r\nIn 1.8 the message is not passed through.  \r\n\r\nWhile the commits reference 1.7.15, I also tried 1.7.3 directly to see if something may have happened in some commits in the 1.7.x line.

Description of Change\r\n\r\nIPC events were not being delivered to renderer processes when both\r\n`contextIsolation` and `sandbox` were enabled.

enabled.\r\n\r\nFixes #11922\r\n\r\ncc @tarruda \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] tests are [changed or

Description of Change\r\n\r\nIPC events were not being delivered to renderer processes when both\r\n`contextIsolation` and `sandbox` were enabled.

enabled.\r\n\r\nFixes #11922\r\n\r\ncc @miniak  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] tests are [changed or
