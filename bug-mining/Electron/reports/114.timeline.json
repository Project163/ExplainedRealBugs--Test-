Here's the pattern I'm seeing on repro:\r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 20.04, Wayland: Does not SIGTRAP\r\n* Ubuntu 20.04, Xorg: Does not SIGTRAP\r\n* Ubuntu 20.04, Unity: Does not SIGTRAP\r\n* Ubuntu 22.04, Wayland: Does not SIGTRAP\r\n* Ubuntu 22.04, Xorg: SIGTRAP\r\n* Ubuntu 22.04, Unity: SIGTRAP\r\n\r\nI wonder if this could be a Unity and/or Xorg bug? Or perhaps we're checking for the existence of something on Wayland that doesn't exist on Unity/Xorg?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/1190903954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VerteDinde","id":4624411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ0MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4624411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde","html_url":"https://github.com/VerteDinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VerteDinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7033831761,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAI8xS85OKV2mzwAAAAGjP8FR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/7033831761","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T00:31:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7033831767,"node_id":"SE_lADOAI8xS85OKV2mzwAAAAGjP8FX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/7033831767","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T00:31:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7033831772,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAI8xS85OKV2mzwAAAAGjP8Fc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/7033831772","actor":{"login":"Jelmerro","id":1696674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro","html_url":"https://github.com/Jelmerro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jelmerro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T00:31:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7033831776,"node_id":"SE_lADOAI8xS85OKV2mzwAAAAGjP8Fg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/7033831776","actor":{"login":"Jelmerro","id":1696674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY2N
