According to https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:storage/browser/blob/blob_memory_controller.cc?q=CalculateBlobStorageLimitsImpl&ss=chromium, a blob of size 65537 should be handled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen calling `session.getBlobData` on a blob with size > 65536, the resulting promise never resolves.\r\n\r\n### Testcase Gist URL\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/b3b9955084b145c77987e4dbc6c81078\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be a possible duplicate of https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/33081, though the other issue includes very little additional information, so I have filed a separate issue to be safe.\r\n\r\nI did a bit of digging through the Electron glue source, and I found the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/61374019c03ab1af8584550277318ba7c2adb0ca/shell/browser/api/electron_api_session.cc#L725-L735\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c4ea33d1bf6faf8ca685e67e63b197d89efa9870/shell/browser/api/electron_api_data_pipe_holder.h#L33-L35\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is related.","closed_by":{"login":"jkleinsc","id":609052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc","html_url":"https://github.com/jkleinsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/34398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/34398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
