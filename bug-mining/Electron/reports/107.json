Preflight Checklist\n\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/electron/electron/issues) for a feature request that matches the one I want to file, without success.\n\n### Electron Version\n\n12.0.6\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nBig Slur 11.3.1\n\n### What arch are you using?\n\nx64\n\n### Last Known Working Electron version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI have several apps that use electron (Slack, Draw.io, Visual Studio Code, Atom), every time there is an update, a dialog pops asking for admin/sudo password to install. The update dialog should *not* consume 100% CPU. \r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe app process runs at 100 percent CPU while waiting for user input confirmation. This happens quite frequently as I use many electron app that have frequent updates, and the high CPU happens for extended periods of time as I am not always present at my computer when the auto update pop up happens.\n\n### Testcase Gist URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis appears to be a problem with an underlying dependency on [Squirrel.Mac](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac) that Electron uses however it would appear that library is no longer maintained - See https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac/issues/256#issue-750706358.\r\n\r\nThere is also a related issue in Squirrel, and comment by jspahrsummers (original author I believe), that he has not worked on with the code base in 6+ years and no longer familiar with it - See  https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac/issues/247#issuecomment-757210176 \r\n\r\nAn example of an update popup dialog below:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-12 at 5 35 36 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5567550/117940700-7e205f00-b348-11eb-8520-9985ce154ef4.png)\r\n\r\nBelow a screenshot of `htop` showing Atom running at 100%.\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-12 at 5 47 49 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5567550/117942582-5c27dc00-b34a-11eb-9cf7-397930c7e4cd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the output from `sample 9096` showing a profile of Atom\r\n[Atom_2021-05-12_174109_EbSY.sample.txt](https://github.com/electron/electron/files/6464575/Atom_2021-05-12_174109_EbSY.sample.txt)\r\n\r\nOther related issues:\r\n  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95534\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/29119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/29119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
