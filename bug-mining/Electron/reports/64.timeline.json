#16883. This bug seems to have been introduced as a side-effect of #15302's menu a11y refactor and is new in 5-0-x.\r\n\r\n#### Description of Change\r\n\r\nThe a11y refactor introduced code that tries to remove pane focus in `atom::MenuBar::OnBeforeExecuteCommand()` whether it has focus or not, and calling `AccessiblePaneView::RemovePaneFocus()` when it doesn't have focus results in a nullptr dereference.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test to check for pane focus before removing it.\r\n\r\nCC @brenca \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [ ] `npm
