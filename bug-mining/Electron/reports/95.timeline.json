Description of Change\r\n\r\nFixes #24741.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed earlier this evening in the @electron/wg-releases meeting. As Sam suggested, reverting 6ecf729 from #20138 fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nManually reverted due to code shear.\r\n\r\nCC @MarshallOfSound @jkleinsc \r\n\r\nNB: A little nuance is necessary on the checklist item \"THIS IS NOT A BREAKING CHANGE\": this PR returns the default value of `darkTheme` on Linux to the same value in stable releases e.g. 9-x-y, but differs from the default value in the 10.0.0 betas. This PR has a sibling to revert in 10-x-y before the 10.0.0 release.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [ ] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] relevant documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples).\r\n- [x] This is **NOT A BREAKING CHANGE**. Breaking changes may not be merged to master until 11-x-y is branched.\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: Fixed a 10.0.0-beta.1 issue that broke dark mode window titlebars on
