Preflight Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/electron/electron/issues) for a bug report that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Electron Version\r\n\r\n`25.9.8`, `26.6.2`, `28.0.0`, `29.0.0-alpha.3`\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nWindows 11 Enterprise 22H2 22621.2715\r\n\r\n### What arch are you using?\r\n\r\nx64\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Electron version\r\n\r\nNone--it doesn't work with any electron version shipping `protocol.handle()`. \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt is [documented](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/net#netfetchinput-init) that if one intercepts a protocol (e.g. given `s: Electron.Session` `s.protocol.handle('http', ...)`) one can forward a request to the built-in handler by passing `bypassCustomProtocolHandlers: true` in the `RequestInit` parameter. \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nHowever, if the request originates from a plain html `<form>` submission, the built-in handler fails with\r\n```\r\nError: net::ERR_FAILED\r\nat SimpleURLLoaderWrapper.<anonymous> (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:49030)\r\nat SimpleURLLoaderWrapper.emit (node:events:517:28)\r\n(node:9824) electron: Failed to load URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/ with error: ERR_UNEXPECTED\r\n```\r\nI observed that the form submission request contains an `origin: null` header and that removing said header from the request allows the request to succeed. The request also succeeds if no custom protocol handler is installed.\r\n\r\n### Testcase Gist URL\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/BurningEnlightenment/83ef1268fa71ebe0fafd9dfa4cc2811f\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe Testcase contains an html form which can be submitted to the included koa webserver.","closed_by":{"login":"jkleinsc","id":609052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc","html_url":"https://github.com/jkleinsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/40754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/40754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
