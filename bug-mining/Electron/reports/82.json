 As an open source project with a dedicated but small maintainer team, it can sometimes take a long time for issues to be addressed so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Preflight Checklist\r\n<!-- Please ensure you've completed the following steps by replacing [ ] with [x]-->\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:** \r\n  * <!-- (output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`) e.g. 4.0.3 --> 5.0.3\r\n* **Operating System:** \r\n  * <!-- (Platform and Version) e.g. macOS 10.13.6 / Windows 10 (1803) / Ubuntu 18.04 x64 --> macOS 10.14\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:** \r\n  * <!-- (if applicable) e.g. 3.1.0 --> n/a\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n`app.moveToApplicationsFolder` should throw when it fails, as the docs say.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\r\n\r\nIt doesn't throw, in fact it even returns `true`.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Have Foo v1 located in `/Applications/Foo.app`\r\n- Open it\r\n- Have Foo v2, still named `Foo.app`, located somewhere else\r\n- Open it\r\n- Use `app.moveToApplicationsFolder`.\r\n- Instead of moving the app the currently open Foo v1 window will be focused, and `app.moveToApplicationsFolder` returns `true` instead of throwing.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18805/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
