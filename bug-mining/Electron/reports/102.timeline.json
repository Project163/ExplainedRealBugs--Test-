Description of Change\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request. Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMicrotasks policy should not be updated for the renderer because\r\n`NodeBindings::CreateEnvironment` might be entered with or without\r\n`UvRunOnce()` on stack. One of the examples of such calls is\r\n`window.open()` which is possible to invoke while `uv_run()` is still\r\nrunning (e.g. with `setImmediate()`).\r\n\r\nAll in all, it doesn't matter that much which policy we use since\r\n`v8::MicrotasksScope` has a check for the policy in its destructor and\r\nno commits will be made if the policy is `kExplicit`. It is important,\r\nhowever, to not change the policy in the middle of `UvRunOnce()` so we\r\nshould respect whatever we currently have and move on.\r\n\r\nFix: #29463\r\n\r\ncc @nornagon @codebytere @deepak1556 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
