did a little investigating on this. I don't have it fully sussed out yet, but I'm about 2/3s of the way there.\r\n\r\nFirst off, [the patch](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24436) that caused this regression -- which, was approved by a couple of people, including me :sweat_smile:  -- introduces a pretty nasty bug. What happens is the worker thread blocks while listening for events in the select() call in `NodeBindingsMac::PollEvents()`. https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24436/files#diff-561e559fd625c5faf91e1efc111348bcR505 contains a semantic change in `NodeBindings::WakeupEmbedThread()` -- previously, its behavior was \"wake up this object's embed thread.\" The new behavior is \"wake up the embed thread unless it's the worker thread. So, when the worker thread's NodeBindings destructor calls `WakeupEmbedThread()`, it's a no-op and the `select()` in `NodeBindingsMac::PollEvents()` never wakes up. This made the `uv_walk()` cash disappear -- *the worker thread never closes*, so the NodeBindings destructor never finishes destructing, and so `uv_walk()` is never reached. :tada: \r\n\r\nSince the threads never finish, we're leaking every resource associated with the NodeBindings object, including the thread, the uv loop, and so on.\r\n\r\nSo the next step is to undo that `NodeBindings::WakeupEmbedThread()` change and figure out where the crash is coming from. I think I have that step figured out and will update the ticket shortly with a PR.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/687460296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3732258453,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MzIyNTg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/3732258453","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a2cea0fdf88d48b60d959de11049d63a32f582c1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/commits/a2cea0fdf88d48b60d959de11049d63a32f582c1","created_at":"2020-09-05T00:41:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-05T01:02:28Z","updated_at":"2020-09-05T01:02:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25332","id":693874575,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgwMzM2MTkx","number":25332,"title":"refactor:

Description of Change\r\n\r\nPart 1 of a fix for #25248, #22069.\r\n\r\nFixes #24965. (h/t @jkleinsc for spotting the connection)\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the `uv_async_t` objects owned by NodeBindings and ElectronBindings inside a new UvHandle wrapper class which handles `uv_handle_t`s' specific rules about destruction:\r\n\r\n> [uv_close()] MUST be called on each handle before memory is released. Moreover, the memory can only be released in close_cb or after it has returned.\r\n\r\nThe UvHandle wrapper class handles this close-delete twostep so that client code doesn't have to think about it. Failure to finish closing before freeing is what caused the uv_walk() crash in #25248.\r\n\r\nCC @codebytere \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md)\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples).\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: Fixed resource leak in worker threads.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/687502060","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/25248#issuecomment-687502060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25248","id":687502060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzUwMjA2MA==","user":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-05T01:03:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-05T01:03:16Z","body":"I've got a partial fix up in #25332 \r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the `uv_async_t` objects owned by NodeBindings and ElectronBindings inside a new UvHandle wrapper class which handles `uv_handle_t`s' specific rules about destruction:\r\n\r\n> [uv_close()] MUST be called on each handle before memory is released. Moreover, the memory can only be released in close_cb or after it has returned.\r\n\r\nThe original crash in #22069 was occurring because ElectronBinding's `uv_async_t call_next_tick_async;`was being deleted _immediately_ after being passed to `uv_close()`. It was attached to the NodeBindings' event loop, which is why walking that loop crashed in NodeBindings' destructor -- that `uv_async_t` was still in the loop as a dangling pointer.\r\n\r\nThe UvHandle wrapper handles the close-delete twostep, fixing the `uv_walk()` crash seen in #22069 in a way that doesn't cause the #25248 regression and which fixes the threads we've been [leaking](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/25248#issuecomment-687460296).

Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n8.4.1 & 9.2.0. **This is actually a regression** the bug seems to not be present in 8.4.0 and 9.1\r\nMy speculation is that it has something to do with some fixes done to address crashes due to terminated workers.\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\nTested mainly on macos, but probably apply to windows as well\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**\r\n8.4.0 and 9.1 (probably also 9.1.1 and or 9.1.2, not sure in which it stopped working)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen a web worker is terminated with `terminate()` its memory should be freed.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nRAM is not released\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nRepo to reproduce: https://github.com/oltreseba/electron-web-worker-example\r\n\r\n- Every 3 second a worker is terminated an restarted\r\n- Old workers are still visible in devtool memory tab\r\n- Old workers keep using RAM according to macos activity monitor (or equivalent, like task manager on window)\r\n\r\nGeneral steps to reproduce:\r\n- Create worker\r\n- Terminate worker\r\n- Notice that it's not clear from memory tab and its memory is not actually freed from the application.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n**In electron 8.4.1:**\r\n<img width=\"328\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-08-12 at 22 27 21\"

when workers are terminated.\r\n\r\n### Preflight Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this

description of what actually happened. -->\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nFirst of all, I don't use pure Electron source codes, there are lots changes of Electron source code\r\nto support electron app on TV device. (I am working to embed Electron to Samsung device)\r\n\r\nWhen a process is exiting, while handles dtor section, it seems that uv__make_close_pending() of UvHandle makes invalid memory write.\r\nFrom my test, when \"uv_is_closing(h)\" returns true, then uv_close() made SIGSEGV (DCHECK_EQ is void function)\r\nThat means that its uv loop was already closed on process termination sequence. (I believe that it is worker related)\r\n\r\nSo, I changed that like below, then issue is gone.\r\n\r\n(shell/common/node_bindings.h)\r\n~~~\r\n  void reset() {\r\n    auto* h = handle();\r\n    if (h != nullptr) {\r\n      DCHECK_EQ(0, uv_is_closing(h));\r\n      if (!uv_is_closing(h))\r\n        uv_close(h, OnClosed);\r\n      else\r\n        OnClosed(h);\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nPlease consider this logic such as stop_and_close_uv_loop()\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n~~~\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  0xb02f0ac8 in uv__make_close_pending () \r\n#1  0xa7d31078 in electron::UvHandle<uv_async_s, (void*)0>::reset() () \r\n#2  0xa7d3134e in electron::NodeBindings::~NodeBindings() () \r\n#3  0xa7d2d1d0 in electron::NodeBindingsLinux::~NodeBindingsLinux() () \r\n#4  0xa7d2d1e2 in electron::NodeBindingsLinux::~NodeBindingsLinux() () \r\n#5  0xa80a1ee0 in electron::ElectronRendererClient::~ElectronRendererClient() () \r\n...\r\n#20 0xb6046868 in __run_exit_handlers () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#21 0xb60469a8 in exit () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#22 0xb602ec88 in __libc_start_main () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#23 0x00498698 in _start ()\r\n~~~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/27210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/27210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
