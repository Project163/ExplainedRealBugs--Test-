fixes #3873\n\n`NSMenu.insertItem` was raising an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` ([see apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenu_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSMenu/insertItem:atIndex:)) when empty Menus were given more empty Menus as submenus. This only happened when `role` was set to `'window'`. Using this example taken from #3873: \n\n```\nvar menu = new Menu();\nmenu.append(new MenuItem({label: 'Window', submenu: new Menu(), type: 'submenu', role: 'window'}));\nMenu.setApplicationMenu(menu);\n```\n\n`menu` is empty. Adding a MenuItem that is also empty with `submenu: new Menu()` raises the exception and crashes Electron. \n\nThe new behavior is that a submenu with no menu items is created as expected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/3968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/3968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":503334201,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTAzMzM0MjAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/503334201","actor":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-31T10:51:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
