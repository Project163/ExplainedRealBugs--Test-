Update widget visibility in `NativeWindowMac::ShowInactive`\r\n\r\nWhen using `views::WebView` on macOS `NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost`\r\ncontains a layer and compositor responsible for drawing web contents.\r\nTo trigger drawing `NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost::OnVisibilityChanged`\r\nneeds to be called and `[NSWindow orderFrontRegardless]` does not trigger\r\n`[NSWindow orderWindow:relativeTo:]` which can change\r\n`NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost` visiblity with stack:\r\n```\r\nviews::NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost::OnVisibilityChanged(bool)\r\nremote_cocoa::NativeWidgetNSWindowBridge::OnVisibilityChanged()\r\n-[ViewsNSWindowDelegate onWindowOrderChanged:]\r\n-[NativeWidgetMacNSWindow orderWindow:relativeTo:]\r\n```\r\n`views::Widget` has method for showing inactive window:\r\n`views::Widget::ShowInactive` which triggers\r\n`NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost::OnVisibilityChanged` with stack:\r\n```\r\nviews::NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost::OnVisibilityChanged(bool)\r\nremote_cocoa::NativeWidgetNSWindowBridge::SetVisibilityState(remote_cocoa::mojom::WindowVisibilityState)\r\nviews::NativeWidgetMacNSWindowHost::SetVisibilityState(remote_cocoa::mojom::WindowVisibilityState)\r\nviews::NativeWidgetMac::Show(ui::mojom::WindowShowState, gfx::Rect const&)\r\nviews::Widget::ShowInactive() + 168\r\n```\r\nHowever this call seems to be insufficient to bring window to front,\r\ntherefore `[NSWindow orderFrontRegardless]` still needs to be called.\r\nCalling `views::Widget::ShowInactive` ensures that all logic related to\r\nshowing Chromium widget will be properly executed, but onfortunately it\r\ndoes not call `[NSWindow orderWindow:relativeTo:]` which is used to\r\ndisabling headless mode by the `ElectronNSWindow`, therefore we need to\r\ntrigger it manually through exposed `[ElectronNSWindow disableHeadlessMode]`.\r\n\r\nFixes: #45415\r\n\r\n#### Description of Change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request.
