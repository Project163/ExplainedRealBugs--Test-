known\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using `webContents.print()`, if the user click the **cancel button** on the print dialog (or on the **\"PDF\" button**) this should: return a callback value of \"false\" (error) or \"true\" (success), but with more details that only \"true\" or \"false\". Something like an error/success message that tell that the cancel button has been clicked..\r\n\r\nThis could be:\r\n\r\n- `success` when the document is sent to the printer\r\n- `cancelled` when the cancel button is clicked\r\n- `pdf` / `other-action`? when the PDF button is clicked\r\n- `failed` when an error occurs\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIn my application, I only want to display a success notification to the user when the print process is successfully launched and an error message when they is an error. For now, false-positive notifications are display when :\r\n\r\n- the cancel button is clicked on the print dialog (return is `false`), we do not know if it is an `error` or a `cancel` event and when an error occurs (return is `false` too), we do not know if it is an `error` or a `cancel` event.\r\n- the \"PDF\" button (only on macOS?) is clicked (return is `true`) and we would know if this is a print `success` or something else to display a \"successfully print\" notification to the user.\r\n\r\nNot tested, but Windows should have the same problem !\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPerhaps linked with #15568 but more specific ?\r\n@codebytere perhaps something that is linked with #17400","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
