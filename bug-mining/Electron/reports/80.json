 As an open source project with a dedicated but small maintainer team, it can sometimes take a long time for issues to be addressed so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we

Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:** 5.0.6\r\n  * <!-- (output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`) e.g. 4.0.3 -->\r\n* **Operating System:** mac OS 10.14.5\r\n  * <!-- (Platform and Version) e.g. macOS 10.13.6 / Windows 10 (1803) / Ubuntu 18.04 x64 -->\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:** Unknown\r\n  * <!-- (if applicable) e.g. 3.1.0 -->\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n`port.postMessage` correctly send UintArray\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\r\n\r\n`port.postMessage` incorrectly appends unexpected number of `0` in buffer\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- clone https://github.com/kwonoj/electron-crx-uintarray\r\n- `npm install && npm start`\r\n- navigate `localhost:8315` on chrome browser, open `chrome-extension://boo/_generated_background_page.html` to observe console message from devtools\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can fork electron-quick-start (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) and include a link to the branch with your changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ npm start || electron .\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n**from Electron@5**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1210596/60470747-7d7bf500-9c16-11e9-8990-994e689acb04.png)\r\n\r\n**from chrome browser**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1210596/60470784-a56b5880-9c16-11e9-9cc9-6701c0cb740a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nhttps://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/344 is caused by this, since every `postMessage` to UnitArray appends `0` to its buffer, operations relying on `0` as default value (unsupported) raises exception on devtools. \r\n\r\nAs attached above, this only happens in Electron (4 / 5 both so far tried) but not occurring on Chrome.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
