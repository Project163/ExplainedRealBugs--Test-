Description of Change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request. Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCallers of `Notification::Dismiss()` assume that the notification instance is not deleted after the call, but this was not the case for `LibnotifyNotification`:\r\n- `Destroy()` would get `this` deleted.\r\n- `notify_notification_close()` in portal environment triggers `LibnotifyNotification::OnNotificationClosed()`, and finally calls `Destroy()`\r\n\r\nThis patch removes all `Destroy()` in `Dismiss()`, and adds a boolean to tell whether `notify_notification_close()` is running, to avoid crash under portal environment.\r\n\r\nFixes #40461.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/development/testing.md)\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/main/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/main/README.md#examples).\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: Fixed crash in Notification::Close() under libnotify 0.8.x with portal environment. <!-- Please add a one-line description for app developers to read in the release notes, or 'none' if no notes relevant to app developers.

@taoky \r\nHope you're doing well!\r\n\r\nI'm using electron `v28.2.5` on the production version, and the user said the app crashed once tried to minimize the app, here is our code for `minimize` event (as I see on the app logs the app crashed before accessing the condition that will determine to hide or minimize the app and create the notification):\r\n```\r\nBrowserWindow.on(\"minimize\", (event) => {\r\n      console.info(\"minimize event fired\");\r\n      BrowserWindow.blur();\r\n      if(// a condition to hide or minimize the app){\r\n      event.preventDefault();\r\n
