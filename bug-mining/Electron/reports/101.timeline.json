making a basic electron app, but when I try to load ipcRenderer in my preload file, it returns without all the event listener methods, including on, once, and removeListener.\r\npreload.js: \r\n```javascript\r\nconst {contextBridge ,ipcRenderer} = require('electron');\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\nconsole.log(ipcRenderer); // returns without event listeners in Electron\r\ncontextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('k',{\r\n    ipcRenderer:ipcRenderer,\r\n    fs:fs,\r\n});\r\n```\r\nmain.js:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst {app, BrowserWindow, Menu} = require('electron');\r\nconst url = require('url');\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\nlet win;\r\n\r\nfunction createWindow() {\r\n   win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600,webPreferences: {nodeIntegration: false,preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),contextIsolation: true}});\r\n   win.loadURL(url.format({\r\n      pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'),\r\n      protocol: 'file:',\r\n      slashes: true\r\n   }));\r\n}\r\n\r\napp.on('ready', createWindow)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I load ipcRenderer in a local file with nodeIntegration enabled, it works fine, but in preload, it doesn't. \r\n\r\nIs this a bug with my code, and if so, what is happening, and what can I do to fix it?\r\n\r\nNote: I'm aware that directly exposing the fs and ipcRenderer APIs is bad security policy, but I can't do anything about that until I fix this. All files are in the same directory. \r\n\r\nConsole output in Electron app of console.log(ipcRenderer)\r\n![Output](https://im9823.surge.sh/k.png)\r\nThis may have some relation to  #27039 or #6828 - I'm not sure whether ipcRenderer is sent across contextBridge before being logged in Electron. \r\n\r\nI am using Macos 11.1 for this. \r\n\r\nUpdate: the problem seems to be with contextBridge - when sent over preload normally (window.ipcRenderer = ipcRenderer), it works fine.
