Preflight Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/electron/electron/issues) for a bug report that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Electron Version\r\n\r\n23.1.0. happened in 19 too\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nwindows 10 21H2\r\n\r\n### What arch are you using?\r\n\r\nx64\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Electron version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nElectron window is started with --remote-debugging-port=9223. Then a test automation tool like Ranorex or a tool like microsoft inspect can spy the electron window to read and/or interact with the DOM. It should be always able to see the whole DOM with all elements. \r\n\r\nTools:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/inspect-objects\r\nhttps://www.ranorex.com/\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nGood: \r\nwhen backgroundThrottling: **true (default)**, the expected behavior is working.\r\n\r\nBad: \r\nwhen backgroundThrottling: **false** is set, the DOM will be hidden after another window hid the electron windows once completley. \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n+ start a spy tool like the one from Ranorex or microsoft and check the electron window. \r\n= you will see all DOM elements (good)\r\n+ move a different window above half of the electron window, Then spy with the spy tool again\r\n= you will see all DOM elements (good)\r\n+ move a different window above the electron window so that it COMPLETELY hides the electron window,\r\n+ bring the electron window into the forground again and try to spy on the window\r\n= you wont be able to see any DOM elements. the dom is empty (bad)\r\n+ resize the electron window by making it full screen and then back to the regular size again. Try to spy on the window again\r\n= you will see all DOM elements (good)\r\n\r\nwas reproducable with different electron apps.  Can be reproduced by using the official electron quickstart repo, add backgroundThrottling: false and adding electron-builder to create a bundle (or probably just bundling it manually should work too).\r\n\r\nThis will be also reported to Ranorex, but i wanted to let you know, too. Because the same behavior can be reproduced with two tools (microsoft inspect) so it is probably a general problem with electron.\r\n\r\n### Testcase Gist URL\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI do not know if those issues could be related:\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/31016\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/36707","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/37490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/37490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/1456902757","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/31016#issuecomment-1456902757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/31016","id":1456902757,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAI8xS85W1pJl","user":{"login":"gmeeker","id":6538028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzgwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6538028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker","html_url":"https://github.com/gmeeker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmeeker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-06T20:12:52Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T20:12:52Z","body":"I'm running into this with v23 as well.

Description of Change\r\n\r\n`viz::DisplayScheduler` is responsible for drawing and swapping frames in the `DisplayScheduler::DrawAndSwap` which is called from the `DisplayScheduler::AttemptDrawAndSwap` if the `DisplayScheduler::ShouldDraw` returns true. `ShouldDraw` depends on the `DisplayScheduler` visibility and when it is not visible then it returns false.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep producing frames, disabling `backgroundThrottling` should also prevent changing `DisplayScheduler` visibility to false.\r\n\r\n`DisplayScheduler` lives in the `ui::Compositor` where every `electron::NativewWindow` has its own `Compositor`. `electron::NativewWindow` may be host of the multiple `electron::api::WebContents` instances which may have different `WebPreferences` settings. Therefore if at least one of the `WebContents` requires disabling throttling then all other `WebContents` using the same window will have it disabled in the `ui::Compositor`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n`backgroundThrottling` set to false will disable frames throttling in the `BrowserWindow` for all `WebContents` displayed by it.\r\n\r\nCloses: [#31016](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/31016)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request.
