your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\n[Beaker browser](http://beakerbrowser.com/) uses `<webview>` elements for loading browser tab content. Unfortunately sites that depend on [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) to return `WindowProxy` for cross site communication via `postMessage` break as Electron always returns `null`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an addition of `webpreferences=\"nativeWindowOpen=yes\"` as described by [`window.open`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/window-open) document it become possible to open links from with-in `<webview>` in a popup window and return [`BrowserWindowProxy`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window-proxy) for cross-site communication, but only if opened windows are popups, which does not allow an app (like Beaker) to provide any UI, or to open link in different `<webview>` as tab instead of window.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally event on `<webview>` (where `window.open()` was called) would dispatch an event, that would allow it's handler to decide where opened document should load into, so it could choose to either open a new Browser window or new `<webview>` or not to open at all.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've [attempted to](https://github.com/gozala/electron-quick-start/tree/window.open) somehow get browser window content rendered into `<webview>` but without any success.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any other solution

y":"## What is this PR\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to fix a problem with message forward between windows context.\r\nWith Mixmax we can start the extension correctly but at the onboarding, when the google modal triggers the extension callback, there is an error with`postMessage` that doesn't work because the opener is undefined (ref: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/16200).\r\n\r\n**Important: this `window-setup` is compatible with our current one wich is [here](https://github.com/getstation/browserX/blob/master/app/static/preload/window-open/window-setup.js)**\r\n\r\n## How does it work: how to fix the bug, and how it was implemented\r\n\r\nThis bunch of code polyfill the `window.opener` in the opened window since there is an issue on the electron, change the dispatched event type and add a Mixmax specific code block.\r\n\r\n### We use `MessageEvent` instead of `Event`\r\nThe small diff is that instead of using `Event` for forwarding `postMessage` we use `MessageEvent`\r\n```js\r\n    event = document.createEvent('Event');\r\n    event.initEvent('message', false, false);\r\n    event.data = message;\r\n    event.origin = sourceOrigin;\r\n    event.source = getOrCreateProxy(ipcRenderer, sourceId);\r\n    window.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n```\r\nis now\r\n```js\r\n     event = new MessageEvent('message', { data: message, origin: sourceOrigin });\r\n     event.source = getOrCreateProxy(ipcRenderer, sourceId);\r\n     win.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n```\r\nWe do this because jQuery sucks in the event detection on webapp and extension side. ~~Should be backported in Station and Electron (we spent a lot of time to find the root source of the bug)~~ not a prerequisite for now.\r\n\r\n### We add a small chunk for Mixmax\r\n```js\r\n     if (event.data && event.data.method === 'loginFinished') {\r\n       win.location.reload();\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe added the code block because the event propagation is blocked at the iframe level (iframe CORS origin blocked in Electron).\r\n\r\n~~It's a workaround for this Electron issue: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9581~~\r\n\r\n~~The `window.open` that opens the authentication popup is being called from an `iframe`,  and given preload are not running in `iframe`, the override of `window.open` is not present.~~\r\n\r\n~~The `window.open` is triggered from a `webFrame`. The opened window use `postMessage` that forwards to the content-script correctly. The propagation stops to work at the iframe window context where lives a proxy between Mixmax extension, and Mixmax web app doesn't catch the `onMessageEvent`. We tried to override the iframe context with `webFrame.getFrameForSelector` but it is not possible right now since there is no preload for `<iframe>`.~~\r\n\r\n## Test instructions\r\n\r\n*using Mixmax extension*\r\n\r\n### Before this PR\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm run playground:reset\r\n$ npm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] At the extension onboarding login the google modal is not closed\r\n\r\n### With this PR\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm run playground:reset\r\n$ npm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] At the extension onboarding login the google modal is closed after submit and the onboarding start\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getstation/electron-chrome-extension/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getstation/electron-chrome-extension/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/452403742","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10401#issuecomment-452403742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/10401","id":452403742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjQwMzc0Mg==","user":{"login":"sofianguy","id":2138661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2138661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy","html_url":"https://github.com/sofianguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T18:32:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T18:32:20Z","body":"Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.\r\n\r\nThe version of Electron you reported this on has been superseded by newer releases. \r\n\r\nIf you're still experiencing this issue in Electron v2.0.x or later, please add a comment specifying the version you're testing with and any other new information that a maintainer trying to reproduce the issue should know.\r\n\r\nI'm setting the `blocked/need-info` label for the above reasons.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!
