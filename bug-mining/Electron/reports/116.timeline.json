The window jumps around when clicking on the window bar, and the Signal window unmaximizes itself when using Alt-Tab to switch between windows.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- Using bullet points, list the steps that reproduce the bug. -->\r\n\r\n1.  Open Signal with options `--enable-features=WaylandWindowDecorations,UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland --no-sandbox`\r\n2.  No window buttons\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the details of the buggy behaviour. -->\r\n\r\nNo window buttons, the window has various glitchy behaviors (it resizes itself or shifts when single-clicking on the window bar or clicking menu items, and unmaximizes itself when pressing Alt-Tab).\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe in detail what the correct behavior should be. -->\r\n\r\nThere should be window buttons, and the window should behave normally (it should stay put, not resize itself or shift when single-clicking on the window bar, and not unmaximize itself when pressing Alt-Tab).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nHow to take screenshots on all OSes: https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/\r\nYou can drag and drop images into this text
