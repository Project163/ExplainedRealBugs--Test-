of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide an example.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor bugs that can be encapsulated in a small experiment, you can use Electron Fiddle (https://github.com/electron/fiddle) to publish your example to a GitHub Gist and link it your bug report.\r\n--> \r\nHere fiddle link: https://gist.github.com/cfe130888196196153f5240e30d8e4b5\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf Fiddle is insufficient to produce an example, please provide an example REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run. You can fork electron-quick-start (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) and include a link to the branch with your changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ npm start || electron .\r\n```\r\n--> \r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/whizyrel/app-bible -b electron-devel\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ electron .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-01 06-57-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38155356/78746232-3289cd80-795e-11ea-9e21-96fdfc9d48ee.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nWith or without the internet speechSynthesis.getVoices() returns an empty array. In the browser, it returns an array of SpeechSynthesisVoice using chrome when the internet is connected.\r\nFurther info:\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis/getVoices","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/22844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/22844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/3153318014","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11585#issuecomment-3153318014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/11585","id":3153318014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAI8xS86789B-","user":{"login":"Achuan-2","id":60436214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDM2MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60436214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2","html_url":"https://github.com/Achuan-2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Achuan-2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-05T05:12:58Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T05:12:58Z","body":"This problem still exists.
