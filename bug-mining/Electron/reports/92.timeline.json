 As an open source project with a dedicated but small maintainer team, it can sometimes take a long time for issues to be addressed so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Preflight Checklist\r\n<!-- Please ensure you've completed the following steps by replacing [ ] with [x]-->\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * LATEST\r\n  \r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * macOS 10.13.6 \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nconst filter = {\r\n     urls: [\r\n          \"file://*.sobot.com/*\"\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nbrowserWindow.webContents.session.webRequest.onBeforeRequest(filter,  (details, callback) => {\r\n            const { id, url, method, resourceType, timestamp, uploadData } = details;\r\n            // url === \"file://users/liutong/Desktop/**/projectName/app/***\"\r\n           callback({\r\n                cancel: false,\r\n                redirectURL: 'http' + url.slice(4)\r\n            })\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe callback of `onBeforeRequest` will be called by any request from the file scheme.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\r\n\r\nFor the above codes, I just want to redirect a request that contains the '*.sobot.com' domain,\r\nBut I received a URL from the local path of `/users/Oliver/Desktop` in the callback of `onBeforeRequest`.\r\n\r\nWhen I add \"file://\\*.sobot.com/\\*\" a rule in the array, for the rule, I actually expected it only to match request that domain is '.sobot.com', but It appears to listen to all requests. e.g \r\n\r\n```\r\n[ \"file://users/Oliver/Desktop/**/projectName/app/caching_resources/***\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can fork electron-quick-start (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) and include a link to the branch with your changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ npm start || electron .\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nAs for my final purpose, you can refer to this [issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19200). so my fallback is to exclude any request that contains a path of 'caching_resources' as to redirect to the `HTTP` scheme.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2494774499,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNDk0Nzc0NDk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/2494774499","actor":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-19T05:37:41Z","assignee":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T05:42:13Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T05:42:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19337","id":470147680,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjk5MTkyMTU1","number":19337,"title":"fix:

Description of Change\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11371.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we didn't consider the return value of the `webRequest` `URLPattern` mate converter, which meant that when the pattern wasn't correctly parsed owing to invalid filter specification users would not be made aware of that fact and would just think that the filtering itself had failed. This corrects that error by moving the business logic of url pattern parsing out of the converter and into the function itself so that granular and specific errors can be thrown.\r\n\r\nThere's also no real reason that i'm aware of not to allow wider breadth of filters by letting users use a wildcard for effective TLD, so I also overrode that (default for the 1-arg `Parse` is not to allow that).\r\n\r\nFinally, I added some examples of url filter types for users to reference.\r\n\r\ncc @MarshallOfSound \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
