Electron version: 1.6.2, 1.6.5, 1.7.6, 2.0.2, 3.x, 4.0.5\r\n* Operating system: Mac OS X Sierra, Linux (Debian Jessie)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nGiven the defined [DesktopCapture API](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/desktop-capturer.md) for capturing both audio and video for the entire desktop, we should get a working audio stream on Windows, Linux and Mac.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nElectron version 4.0.5: On Mac and Linux, the error callback triggers with the respective messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetUserMediaError:  DOMException: Could not start audio source // Mac\r\nFailed to query stereo recording // Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\nElectron Version 1.7.6: On Mac and Linux, the error callback triggers with the error: \r\n\r\n```\r\nNavigatorUserMediaError\r\n    constraintName: \"\"\r\n    message: \"\"\r\n    name: \"TrackStartError\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nElectron Version 1.6.2 and 1.6.5: On Mac and Linux, the video stream is received successfully, albeit, with no audio.\r\n\r\nBelow are the constraints defined as per the DesktopCapture API: \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst constraints = {\r\n  audio: {\r\n    mandatory: {\r\n      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  video: {\r\n    mandatory: {\r\n      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note: on Windows, the audio capture works correctly. \r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/mhashmi/electron-desktop-capture\r\ncd electron-desktop-capture\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/10515/reactions","total_count":50,"+1":50,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/10515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
