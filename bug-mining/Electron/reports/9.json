All other MIDI messages and the Web MIDI API seem to work as expected and sending/receiving Sysex is successful in the Chrome browser (with https).\n\nI've filed a bug with [Chromium](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=526243) and it's looking like this could be a Electron issue instead. The latest response to that issue is below:\n\n> Even though file:// is treated as a-priori secure (via chrome/browser/permissions/permission_context_base.h's IsRestrictedToSecureOrigins), it still has to get directed through the [MidiPermissionContext to grant access](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/media/midi_permission_context.cc&rcl=1440948402&l=19).\n> \n> The permission context in Chrome is handled by chrome/browser/media , but perhaps Electron is not properly promulgating a permission context through. Either way, sounds like an Electron bug, not Chromium.\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/2669/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/2669/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
