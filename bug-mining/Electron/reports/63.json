I assumed it was codesiging, or identities, or a provisioning profile, or even my virtual machine. It isn't. \r\n\r\nFor someone with a Mac setup, [this repo](https://github.com/rr326/ElectronSecurityScopedBookmarkTest) will make it easy to test. \r\n\r\nAlso, looking at the code, the results I am seeing should not happen. It shouldn't even be possible! But I don't know C++ and also can't get Electron to build, so I'm at a dead end. The only thing I can imagine is somehow the settings to `showOpenDialog()` are getting overwritten or changed somehow. \r\n\r\nSee the code here:  \r\n[atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c8c1be7ae546da4679a22b6872f023c9786df663/atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm#L287-L313). Particularly [OpenDialogComplettion](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c8c1be7ae546da4679a22b6872f023c9786df663/atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm#L287-L313) and [GetBookMarkDataFromNSURL](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c8c1be7ae546da4679a22b6872f023c9786df663/atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm#L228-L251)\r\n\r\nOne strange thing - there are TWO `ShowOpenDialog()` in this file. Is that ok? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/16664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/16664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
