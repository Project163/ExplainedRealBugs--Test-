After some triaging, we discovered it was caused by going over 127 characters on Windows.\n\nhttps://github.com/twolfson/google-music-electron/issues/24\n\nWe have created a proof of concept gist to reproduce the issue. We are using Windows 7 from `ievms` but the initial report was on Windows 10 so that should work as well.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/twolfson/3dbd1ff7e4641e512849\n\nWe aren't sure whether this is something that `electron` can resolve or not. But at the very least, we think it should be documented.\n\nIn the meantime, we will be adding truncation in `google-music-electron` to avoid future issues.\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/3290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/3290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
