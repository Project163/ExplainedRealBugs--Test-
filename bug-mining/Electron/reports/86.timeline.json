above-referenced [chromimum issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=419673) says `StatusNotifier`/DBus support got added and something got removed. So I looked up things on the internet and got the tray icon well displayed but only on Manjaro XFCE so far (have not tried anything KDE based yet though, might be working well there):\r\n- Manjaro XFCE (possibly any distro that uses XFCE, like Xubuntu): `xfce4-statusnotifier-plugin` needs to be installed and then respective widget added to the panel. So `xfce4-panel`/built-in systray plugin named \"notification area\" is not sufficient anymore. Plugins work well if both activated, no conflicts noticed.\r\n- Ubuntu 19.04 Gnome Shell: [KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) extension is supposed to handle the need as it seems to be supporting \"status notifier/dbus\" thing. But it's not welll displayed, there is still that subtle tiny dot instead of a full tray icon. So further digging is needed.\r\n\r\nThe side benefit I noticed is that the left/primary mouse click is being properly handled again after it's being broken starting from the @electron v3, see #14941. So now right click and left click are treated as a different action. Besides `xfce4-statusnotifier-plugin` is capable enough to optionally cancel this/proper behavior, so if someone needs it both right and left clicks still could trigger a single action - menu opening (it's good that the respective checkbox is turned off by default so we have right and left clicks working individually).\r\n\r\nSince for now, there is no fully reliable way to guarantee that the tray icon is properly shown on Linux using electron v8+ I'm considering making \"startMinimizedToTray\" option disabled by default in [ElectronMail](https://github.com/vladimiry/ElectronMail). I will then add a note `make sure you have got the tray icon displayed before enabling this option as you will be using tray icon to show/hide the app window` near to the respective checkbox in the UI. That would not be the best move in terms of UX but it's better than if a user starts the app and doesn't see it started as there is no tray icon and so no way to get the app window displayed, basically no visible signs of the app got

I finally got the tray icon displayed on Linux in one case using @electron version 8 I played around for a while and noticed a few more issues which I'm going to place separately later if I will be able to narrow down the scope and create minimal reproducible projects for them. The following issues (based on preliminary observations):\r\n- It looks like if the async/delayed action is being triggered via the tray menu the app crashes/segfaults. Possibly any kind of actions, not only the async ones, not completely clear yet. If I trigger the same action not via the tray menu then there is no crush.\r\n- The tray menu items don't get updated dynamically as it worked in @electron version lower than 8, at least the `visible` property when I re-create the tray menu calling `tray.setContextMenu(Menu.buildFromTemplate([...updated items...]))`.\r\n\r\nThese issues are off the topic here but wanted to highlight that in general, it's more than just tray icon not being displayed on Linux but the tray menu behavior is also changed.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/565107295/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vladimiry","id":1560781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjA3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1560781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimiry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimiry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2878782713,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg3ODc4MjcxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/2878782713","actor":{"login":"electon","id":36130313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36130313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon","html_url":"https://github.com/electon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-12T17:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2878782715,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4Nzg3ODI3MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/2878782715","actor":{"login":"electon","id":36130313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36130313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon","html_url":"https://github.com/electon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-12T17:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2878786863,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg3ODc4Njg2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/2878786863","actor":{"login":"electron","id":13409222,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzNDA5MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13409222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron","html_url":"https://github.com/electron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electron/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-12T17:35:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
