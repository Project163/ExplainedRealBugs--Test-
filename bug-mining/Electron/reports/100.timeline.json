Description of Change\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/22069.\r\n\r\nNot calling this final `async_send` in the context of a worker loop fixes this issue for reasons i'm still fully sussing out. What happens at present is that when it is called, it somehow corrupts the libuv loop on what i currently believe is a threading issue. The root cause of this is the `delete this` call in `web_worker_observer` but I believe this is the most direct fix.\r\n\r\nTested with https://github.com/trusktr/electron-web-worker-example.\r\n\r\nWhen you hit reload a handful of times without this fix it reliably crashes the renderer, and after this fix no crashes are seen. \r\n\r\ncc @ckerr @zcbenz \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Description of Change\r\n\r\nPart 1 of a fix for #25248, #22069.\r\n\r\nFixes #24965. (h/t @jkleinsc for spotting the connection)\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the `uv_async_t` objects owned by NodeBindings and ElectronBindings inside a new UvHandle wrapper class which handles `uv_handle_t`s' specific rules about destruction:\r\n\r\n> [uv_close()] MUST be called on each handle before memory is released. Moreover, the memory can only be released in close_cb or after it has returned.\r\n\r\nThe UvHandle wrapper class handles this close-delete twostep so that client code doesn't have to think about it. Failure to finish closing before freeing is what caused the uv_walk() crash in #25248.\r\n\r\nCC @codebytere \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x]

Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of

without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * 10.1.4\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * Linux (Samsung device)\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**\r\n  * <!-- (if applicable) e.g. 3.1.0 -->\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nFirst of all, I don't use pure Electron source codes, there are lots changes of Electron source code\r\nto support electron app on TV device. (I am working to embed Electron to Samsung device)\r\n\r\nWhen a process is exiting, while handles dtor section, it seems that uv__make_close_pending() of UvHandle makes invalid memory write.\r\nFrom my test, when \"uv_is_closing(h)\" returns true, then uv_close() made SIGSEGV (DCHECK_EQ is void function)\r\nThat means that its uv loop was already closed on process termination sequence. (I believe that it is worker related)\r\n\r\nSo, I changed that like below, then issue is gone.\r\n\r\n(shell/common/node_bindings.h)\r\n~~~\r\n  void reset() {\r\n    auto* h = handle();\r\n    if (h != nullptr) {\r\n      DCHECK_EQ(0, uv_is_closing(h));\r\n      if (!uv_is_closing(h))\r\n        uv_close(h, OnClosed);\r\n      else\r\n        OnClosed(h);\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nPlease consider this logic such as stop_and_close_uv_loop()\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n~~~\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  0xb02f0ac8 in uv__make_close_pending () \r\n#1  0xa7d31078 in electron::UvHandle<uv_async_s, (void*)0>::reset() () \r\n#2  0xa7d3134e in electron::NodeBindings::~NodeBindings() () \r\n#3  0xa7d2d1d0 in electron::NodeBindingsLinux::~NodeBindingsLinux() () \r\n#4  0xa7d2d1e2 in electron::NodeBindingsLinux::~NodeBindingsLinux() () \r\n#5  0xa80a1ee0 in electron::ElectronRendererClient::~ElectronRendererClient() () \r\n...\r\n#20 0xb6046868 in __run_exit_handlers () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#21 0xb60469a8 in exit () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#22 0xb602ec88 in __libc_start_main () from ./lib/libc.so.6\r\n#23 0x00498698 in _start ()\r\n~~~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/27210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/27210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
