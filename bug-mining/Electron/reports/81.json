Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * v7.0.0-nightly.20190614\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * macOS 10.14.5\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**\r\n  * none\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n* Using an accelerator without a modifier to activate a menu item (e.g. pressing key 'B') should result in `triggeredByAccelerator: true`.\r\n* Clicking on a menu item with a menu item (e.g. Shift+Click) should result in `triggeredByAccelerator:false`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n* Using an accelerator without a modifier to activate a menu item (e.g. pressing key 'B') results in `triggeredByAccelerator: false`.\r\n* Clicking on a menu item while holding down a modifier key (e.g. Shift+Click) results in `triggeredByAccelerator:true`.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nElectron Fiddle gist: https://gist.github.com/19163d031cf3e35bb7b163bd2c39305c\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    label: \"Blade\",\r\n    id: \"blade\",\r\n    accelerator: \"B\",\r\n    click(a, b, e) {\r\n        console.log(e);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can fork electron-quick-start (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) and include a link to the branch with your changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ npm start || electron .\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8472721/59542262-c5321b00-8eb9-11e9-9e8b-c891b20cfe77.png)\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nThe property is currently derived from some event modifier flags (on Mac: `NSEvent.modifierFlags`). When using an accelerator with a modifier key, these flags are set and the property works as expected.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n```cpp\r\nv8::Local<v8::Object> CreateEventFromFlags(v8::Isolate* isolate, int flags) {\r\n  mate::Dictionary obj = mate::Dictionary::CreateEmpty(isolate);\r\n  obj.Set(\"shiftKey\", static_cast<bool>(flags & ui::EF_SHIFT_DOWN));\r\n  obj.Set(\"ctrlKey\", static_cast<bool>(flags & ui::EF_CONTROL_DOWN));\r\n  obj.Set(\"altKey\", static_cast<bool>(flags & ui::EF_ALT_DOWN));\r\n  obj.Set(\"metaKey\", static_cast<bool>(flags & ui::EF_COMMAND_DOWN));\r\n  obj.Set(\"triggeredByAccelerator\", static_cast<bool>(flags));\r\n  return obj.GetHandle();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/event_emitter.cc#L85 \r\n\r\nHowever, either triggering an accelerator without a modifier key (or clicking an accelerator with a modifier key) will give an invalid result. The `triggeredByAccelerator` logic should be decoupled from the modifier flags.\r\n\r\nA better approach covering the edge case of not using a modifier is to use `NSEvent.type` to distinguish between a click or a keydown. Fix should go [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/6f91af93433df4e9c0e7fb592e5b2dcb0b1c7888/atom/browser/ui/cocoa/atom_menu_controller.mm#L307).\r\n\r\ncc @codebytere @erickzhao ","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18808/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
