For example, [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) is a great tool for making small test cases and makes it easy to publish your test case to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) that Electron maintainers can use.\n\nStand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.\n\nI'm adding the `blocked/need-info` label for this reason.

Description of Change\r\n\r\nAs reported in #44336, commit 478defb15c036eb749617ad65633b4eecd02cc66 now causes electron to freezes when using a custom spell checker.\r\n\r\n`ReadUnicodeCharacter` updates index to the last character read, and not after it. We need to manually increment it to move to the next character.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't validate that the index is valid, so we need to check that index is within bounds.\r\n\r\nRefs:
