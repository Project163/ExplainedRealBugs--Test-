 As an open source project with a dedicated but small maintainer team, it can sometimes take a long time for issues to be addressed so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Preflight Checklist\r\n<!-- Please ensure you've completed the following steps by replacing [ ] with [x]-->\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * 6.0.0-beta.4\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * Windows 10 (17763)\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**\r\n  * 5.0.1\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nLoading `chrome://gpu` in a `BrowserWindow` shows the page as it does in the [equivalent](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Win_x64%2F655764%2Fchrome-win.zip?generation=1556747765859143&alt=media) Chromium version (76.0.3783.1).\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nGarbage text is rendered in the window.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Use electron-quick-start\r\n2. Edit the line to `mainWindow.loadURL('chrome://gpu')`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3041926/58550511-c7cc1980-8205-11e9-99dd-1905edb7ac77.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nI want to use this page to view the GPU log at the bottom to diagnose crashes and canvas elements going blank. Unlike the GPU information, the log doesn't seem to be accessible via any electron API.","closed_by":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
