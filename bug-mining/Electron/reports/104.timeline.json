Code looks like this in main process:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsetInterval(async () => {\r\n    const options: Electron.SourcesOptions = {\r\n      types: [\"window\"],\r\n      fetchWindowIcons: true,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    getLogger().debug(\"Calling getSources\");\r\n    const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources(options);\r\n    getLogger().debug(\"Finished sources\");\r\n}, 10000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes running, I can only see a lot of `\"Calling getSources\"` lines in log - i.e., the call does not resolve. Electron version is 11.3.0 (previously, with version 11.1.1, app would simply freeze after entering a `getSources` call, but after updating it does not make app freeze, but does not return either).\r\n\r\nPs: platform in this case in Windows. Should I open a separate issue? Behavior seems the same as the one described here.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/786668311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leandrogomide","id":4389872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODk4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4389872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide","html_url":"https://github.com/leandrogomide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/788195719","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/25595#issuecomment-788195719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/25595","id":788195719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4ODE5NTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"leandrogomide","id":4389872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODk4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4389872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide","html_url":"https://github.com/leandrogomide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandrogomide/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-01T19:07:49Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T19:32:22Z","body":"Electron returns the same Promise object if two successive calls to `getSources` are made with equal arguments.

Description of Change\r\n\r\n`desktopCapturer.getSources()` returns a promise which should resolve\r\nwhen capturing finishes. Internally it creates an instance of\r\nDesktopCapturer which is responsible for resolving or rejecting\r\nthe promise.\r\n\r\nBetween the time DesktopCapturer starts capturing frames and when\r\nit finishes, it's possible for its handle to be GC'd leading to\r\nit never resolving.\r\n\r\nThese changes pin the instance of DesktopCapturer until it either\r\nfinishes or errors.\r\n\r\nfixes #25595\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nTo verify the fix, I ran this Fiddle gist which normally fails after 10-30 seconds without the fix\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/90f43a52e7c48a531a57bec77428e11a\r\n\r\ncc @codebytere \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
