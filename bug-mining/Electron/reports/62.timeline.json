#14490\r\n\r\n##### Description of Change\r\nPoints that are taken in as input to Electron API's are now auto rounded if floats are provided as input.  E.g. `{ x: 5.5, y: 6 }` becomes `{ x: 6, y: 6 }`.  This is the current expected user workaround and will have no impact on currently working code however I consider this `semver/minor`.\r\n\r\n##### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: Point based API's now automatically round incoming `x` and `y` values","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/14604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/14604/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1842991079,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NDI5OTEwNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/1842991079","actor":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"84b71a37d9ef1a01d3108af34ceebd0269f2a77f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/commits/84b71a37d9ef1a01d3108af34ceebd0269f2a77f","created_at":"2018-09-13T08:16:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1843625390,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg0MzYyNTM5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/1843625390","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-13T13:28:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1843625932,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NDM2MjU5MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/1843625932","actor":{"login":"ckerr","id":70381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr","html_url":"https://github.com/ckerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"73a1a8b3f010b592cdcbfa28a927e5892a3a91a5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/commits/73a1a8b3f010b592cdcbfa28a927e5892a3a91a5","created_at":"2018-09-13T13:29:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
