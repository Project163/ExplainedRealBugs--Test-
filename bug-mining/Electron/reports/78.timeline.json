Description of Change\r\nFixes #18502\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `focus` and `blur` events that we emit in Electron to listen to changes in key window rather than main window. It swaps out `windowDidBecomeMain` and `windowDidResignMain` for `windowDidBecomeKey` and `windowDidResignKey`, respectively.\r\n\r\nIt seems to work as intended now. Also added a new test to test this exact situation. Please let me know if there's a less convoluted way to test this specific case, since it seems like I'm listening to a very specific series of events. Test seems to be working locally on my end, and fails on a downloaded CI build from `master`. ✅ \r\n\r\n##### Context\r\n\r\nIn our macOS code, the `NativeWindowMac::Show()` function in `native_window_mac.mm` calls this [`beginSheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/1419653-beginsheet) function, which specifies that:\r\n>If the window has no presented sheets, this method displays the specified sheet, **makes it key**, and returns control to the caller. While the sheet remains visible, most events targeted at the receiver are prohibited.\r\n\r\nFor additional context, see [Apple developer documentation on key and main windows](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Concepts/ChangingMainKeyWindow.html) here.\r\n\r\nFiddle: https://gist.github.com/c9c19684f6e0d23c102161fb3e86500b\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\ncc @codebytere @DeerMichel \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders

Description of Change\r\n\r\n##### Context\r\nIn PR #18995, I had submitted a fix such that `focus` and `blur` events were listening for changes in the Key window rather than the Main window.\r\n\r\nHowever, Issue #19124 showed that since a window would lose its Key status when the [macOS Character Viewer](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201586) was activated, the `blur` event would make any input on the window lose its focus.\r\n\r\nThen, the character selected from the Character Viewer wouldn't be entered into the input.\r\n\r\n##### Change\r\n\r\nI did not find much documentation regarding the behavior of `NSWindow` with respect to the Character Viewer. After playing around with `windowDidResignKey`, I found that when the Character Viewer appears, the window loses its Key status, but the `[NSApp keyWindow]` variable still referenced the original window.\r\n\r\nThus, I added a conditional check to only apply the `blur` event if the resigning window and the new key window weren't the same.\r\n\r\ncc @codebytere @zcbenz @javan \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
