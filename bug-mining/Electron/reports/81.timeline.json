Description of Change\r\nFixes #18808 \r\n\r\nPreviously, the `triggeredByAccelerator` flag would be entirely coupled with whether or not the modifier keys were being used or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR swaps out the `ui::EventFlagsFromModifiers([event modifierFlags]))` call in the macOS code to `ui::EventFlagsFromNSEventWithModifiers(event, [event modifierFlags]))`. The latter outputs flags that take into account mouse click events on top of modifier flags ([see Chromium documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/75.0.3770.90/ui/events/cocoa/cocoa_event_utils.mm)).\r\n\r\nThe business logic to detect `triggeredByAccelerator` is then changed to exclude any mouse click flags.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a broken test was changed to properly detect that the accelerator registers properly and that the `triggeredByAccelerator` flag is properly detected.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
