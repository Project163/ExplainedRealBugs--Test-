**Electron Version:**\r\n  * 5.0.0-beta5\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * Windows 10 (1803) x64, Raspberry Pi Debian Stretch\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**:\r\n  * 3.0.3\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nStarting electron with --inspect=XXXX or --inspect-brk=XXXX should open the port XXXX for connecting with a debugger that supports the inspect protocol (e.g. VS Code).\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nIf --inspect=XXXX or --inspect-brk=XXXX is supplied the opened port is always 9229 regardless of the supplied port XXXX. Depending on --inspect or inspect-brk the application starts or waits. Without supplying either no port is opened\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nStart electron with the arguments stated above.","closed_by":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
