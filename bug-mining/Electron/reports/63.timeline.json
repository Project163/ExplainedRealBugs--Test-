Look at the ShowOpenDialog function in atom_api_dialog.cc, there it calls either one of those.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that here https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c8c1be7ae546da4679a22b6872f023c9786df663/atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm#L302 the security_scoped_bookmarks flag is false and we proceed to call ReadDialogPaths. Looking at that implementation here https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c8c1be7ae546da4679a22b6872f023c9786df663/atom/browser/ui/file_dialog_mac.mm#L264, it calls ReadDialogPathsWithBookmarks (which we want to call originally) but discards the returned bookmarks.

Personally I'd put some logging code in to confirm that the parameters I set (settings.security_scoped_bookmarks) are in fact the same as what the function is getting. If not, then something else is amiss. \r\n\r\nBut as  I said this is beyond my ability to debug so if someone wants to do a build I'd be happy to test it on my setup.

I think I found the cause of the problem and fixed it. Right now it's a branch in my fork and I will now try to submit a PR. You can find it here https://github.com/jfuechsl/electron/commit/6a55a2b57dba36f4770262e67ab24901268a50d9.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is: ShowOpenDialog is invoked with a `settings` object which holds the `security_scoped_bookmarks` flag. This object is then passed to the completion handler of the dialog where the flag is eventually accessed inside of `OpenDialogCompletion`. Since `settings` is passed as reference, the content of the object could (and in our case does) change before the completion handler is executed - this _somehow_ flips the `security_scoped_bookmarks` flag back to `false`.\r\n\r\nMy fix is to capture the flag in the calling environment (`ShowOpenDialog` and `ShowSaveDialog`) and then only pass the flag as value to the completion handler (we only access the flag there anyway).\r\n\r\nIt now works as documented in my examples. I hope to be able to submit the PR very soon and get it merged if it looks ok to others.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/466673877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jfuechsl","id":1097068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTcwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl","html_url":"https://github.com/jfuechsl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2162889913,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNjI4ODk5MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/2162889913","actor":{"login":"jfuechsl","id":1097068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTcwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl","html_url":"https://github.com/jfuechsl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2a3007f083d6b291de19449dff3fd49da703599e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jfuechsl/electron/commits/2a3007f083d6b291de19449dff3fd49da703599e","created_at":"2019-02-25T20:15:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jfuechsl","id":1097068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTcwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl","html_url":"https://github.com/jfuechsl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfuechsl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T20:20:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T20:20:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17126","id":414288823,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjU2MDMyNzc4","number":17126,"title":"fix:

handler.\r\nHowever at the time the completion handler is invoked, the settings\r\nobject is already out-of-scope, resulting in an invalid access to\r\nthe security_scoped_bookmarks flag.\r\nThe fix
