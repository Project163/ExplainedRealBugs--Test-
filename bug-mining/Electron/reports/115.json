This issue however, only focuses on the part where we decide whether we should allow users to require modules with names falling into this regex - `electron/.*` (not `package.json` in particular).\r\n* This is likely happening due to the way https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/b1463d2da138dcbc20d87cf31b9807d697690592/lib/common/reset-search-paths.ts#L55-L61 is written.
