After a crop, copying the image will crash the program and will not be copied to the clipboard. Same behavior on Main and Render processes.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have the following code on a render file, but putting it in the main file will yield similar results.\r\n\r\n```node\r\nconst {nativeImage, clipboard} = require('electron');\r\n\r\n// 4592x3056 image (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1431512284068-4c4002298068)\r\nlet image = nativeImage.createFromPath('./test.jpg');\r\n\r\n// Works (copies as intended)\r\nclipboard.writeImage(image);\r\n\r\nimage = image.crop({\r\n    x: 20,\r\n    y: 40,\r\n    width: 400,\r\n    height: 200\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Doesn't work (crashes)\r\nclipboard.writeImage(image);\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/8017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/8017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
