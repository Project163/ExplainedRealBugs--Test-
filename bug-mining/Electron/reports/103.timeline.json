I have created an app window that is frameless with a custom titlebar and drag region. I am definitely seeing the loss of mouse events. I have custom hover effects on the various minimize, maximize, close buttons and if the mouse pointer leaves the main window immediately after it triggered a hover on one of these buttons the hover effect is not removed to return the button to it's original state.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/67915450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"frankhale","id":190154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDE1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/190154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale","html_url":"https://github.com/frankhale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/67935163","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/611#issuecomment-67935163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/611","id":67935163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTM1MTYz","user":{"login":"MartinMa","id":123297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzI5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinMa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-23T09:43:16Z","updated_at":"2014-12-23T11:51:43Z","body":"On Windows, I think it's necessary to track the mouse events by calling the [TrackMouseEvent function](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646265%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) in order to be able to receive the `WM_MOUSELEAVE` message.\n\nI don't fully comprehend how and where `atom-shell` handles windows messages. Where do I actually find the message loop?\n\nAnyhow, this is _basically_ how chromium (Google Chrome) seems to do it in their `HWNDMessageHandler` class.\n\n``` c++\nif (message == WM_MOUSEMOVE || message == WM_NCMOUSEMOVE)\n{\n    // Windows only fires WM_MOUSELEAVE events if the application begins\n    // \"tracking\" mouse events for a given HWND during WM_MOUSEMOVE events.\n    // We need to call |TrackMouseEvents| to listen for WM_MOUSELEAVE.\n    TrackMouseEvents((message == WM_NCMOUSEMOVE) ?

The code get's slightly more complicated, when incorporating `SetCapture` and `ReleaseCapture` for proper right-click handling on the caption bar (\"to ensure we only show the sys-menu when the button down and up are both on the caption\").\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/67935163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MartinMa","id":123297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzI5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinMa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinMa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/94332189","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/611#issuecomment-94332189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/611","id":94332189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzMyMTg5","user":{"login":"Keavon","id":4388688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODg2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4388688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon","html_url":"https://github.com/Keavon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keavon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:22:57Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:22:57Z","body":"This
