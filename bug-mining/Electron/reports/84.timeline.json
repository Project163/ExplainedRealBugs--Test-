Description of Change\r\n\r\nFixes #19911: don't spill command-line switch scheme values into other switches.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR uses move semantics to move the tokens from a temporary container into their destination container.\r\n\r\nVerified by adding this temporary code to the end of `AtomContentClient::AddAdditionalSchemes()`:\r\n\r\n```cc\r\n#define DUMP_SCHEMES(name) \\\r\n
