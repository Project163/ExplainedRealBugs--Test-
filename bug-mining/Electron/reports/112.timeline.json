Currently Electron uses `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR` to tell the WM to hide an app from the taskbar.\r\n\r\n### GNOME\r\n\r\nAccording to [wayland-bites](https://wayland-bites.github.io/) the equivalent to `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR` on GNOME is with `Window.is_skip_taskbar`, but that \"Since GNOME 41, WaylandClient, Workspace, WorkspaceManager, IdleMonitor and Window Meta APIs are available only to GNOME Extensions or in the unsafe mode.\"\r\n\r\nThe same page says that \"WaylandClient.{hide_from|show_in}_window_list\" might also be an approach, but that \"WaylandClient controls only subprocess surfaces\".\r\n\r\n### KWin\r\n\r\nOn the KWin side, the `KWin::Toplevel::skipTaskbar` is the API to use but \"[the] KWin Scripting API is available only to dedicated registered scripts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n... in short, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this anymore in a Wayland world, and the tradeoffs involved (e.g. running in unsafe mode) are IMO not worth the cost.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to be proven wrong if someone knows of a better workaround, but if the above is correct IMO we should update the documentation to say that `skipTaskbar` is not supported

CHANGE\r\n\r\n#### Description of Change\r\n\r\nCloses #33124.\r\n\r\n`skipTaskbar` has no effect on Wayland. Currently Electron uses `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR` to tell the WM to hide an app from the taskbar, and this works fine on X11 but there's no equivalent mechanism in Wayland. There _are_ some workarounds available on different systems, e.g. GNOME and KWin, but they some unacceptable tradeoffs, e.g. `Window.is_skip_taskbar` requires unsafe mode.\r\n\r\ntl;dr I don't see a way to support this feature on Linux anymore.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the documentation to reflect that it's only supported on macOS / Windows and makes an announcement in \"breaking changes\" (it's broken already, but better to document it here for visibility).\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [ ] `npm test` passes\r\n- [ ] tests are [changed or
