Electron version: `2.0.0-beta.1`\r\n* Operating system: macOS\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPreload script should execute once\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPreload script (and in fact `node_bootstrap.js`) is executed twice in the same process but in a different context.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nStruggling to isolate this from the application that is experiencing it but I have narrowed it down to this being _kind of_ expected behavior but with a newly introduced bug in `2.0.x`.  Basically when you call `loadURL` a renderer process is initially launched pointing at `about:blank`.  In this process `renderer/init.js` is called and then the window navigates to the URL you requested.\r\n\r\nFor an as yet unknown reason in `2.0.x` the `--preload` argument is present on the renderer process when the `about:blank` page is loaded causing user code to execute twice in the same process.  This is only a problem because native modules can only be loaded once in a given process.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this would be to revert to original behavior where the `--preload` (amongst others) arguments are not sent to the renderer until the users page is loaded.  (Don't send them for `about:blank`).\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a minimal sample\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/12045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/12045/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
