Description of Change\r\nFixes #17937 and #19908 \r\n\r\nOriginally fixed in #10223, but regressed in #14835, the fix here is to make sure our one-shot DesktopCapturer class destroys its `DesktopMediaList` instances (which in turn hold the real capturers) after it finishes gathering the thumbnails. If you'll recall, we use `DesktopMediaList` in a way that's different from Chrome; theirs is longer lived and capable of updating the thumbnails, ours is single-use, with the periodic thumbnail update overridden in a patch.\r\n\r\nFor good hygiene, we now send the reference to the cpp DesktopCapturer out to pasture after we're done with it (although after this change, a leak of DesktopCapturer would be much less costly, given the `DesktopMediaList`s are being reset).\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request.
