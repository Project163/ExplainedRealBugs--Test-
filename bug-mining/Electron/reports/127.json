When the same browserView is added multiple times to a browserWindow, the browserView will first be removed and then re-added.\nSpecifically, this causes a jump in the page's visibility inside the browserView, and the visibilitychange event is triggered unexpectedly.\n\nThe impl of  'addBrowserView'  in different versions:\nelectron 29: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v29.4.6/shell/browser/api/electron_api_base_window.cc#L762\nelectron 30: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v30.0.0/lib/browser/api/browser-window.ts#L178\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/48057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/48057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
