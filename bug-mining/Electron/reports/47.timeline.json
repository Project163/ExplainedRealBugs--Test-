execute under the same conditions as it did the first time.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSomething seems to change between the first load and subsequent loads, where in some subsequent loads (but never initial load) calls to `require('electron').remote.app.getAppPath()` and possibly other remote aspects will sometimes throw:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnable to load preload script:

`remote.app.getAppPath()` would sometimes trigger it on 2.0.0-beta.4 but never (100% confirmed) on 2.0.0-beta.3.\r\n\r\nHopefully you can reproduce it, my current setup will take time to extrapolate a

a single synchronous IPC call to retrieve data required by early\r\nsandbox scripts.

By loading\r\n  webContentsId very early and skipping remote module at early\r\n  startup, we fix it for
