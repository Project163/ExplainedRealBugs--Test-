Preflight Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/electron/electron/issues) for a bug report that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Electron Version\r\n\r\n16.0.7\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Build 19043\r\n\r\n### What arch are you using?\r\n\r\nx64\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Electron version\r\n\r\n13.1.2\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient(protocol, process.execPath, [path.resolve(process.argv[1]), '--arg']);`\r\nto work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nelectron will put quotes around the entire list of arguments instead of each individually (if necessary), so the generated command is something like\r\n\r\n\"C:\\example\\node_modules\\electron\\dist\\electron.exe\" \"c:\\example --arg\" \"%1\"\r\n\r\nwhich then leads to an error \"Unable to find Electron app at c:\\example --args\".\r\n\r\n### Testcase Gist URL\r\n\r\n!!! Please note that by the nature of setAsDefaultProtocolClient this testcase will make a systemwide setting!\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/a1f2fdbe04624b6f7a6877a89581143c\r\n\r\n### Additional
