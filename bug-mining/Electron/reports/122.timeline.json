Description of Change\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/43462\r\n\r\nDuring BrowserView auto-resize, the new size is calculated using BrowserView#lastWindowSize, but lastWindowSize is never updated and remains the value from the initial window size. This results in BrowserView being resized incorrectly.\r\nTo fix this issue, we should update lastWindowSize to the current window size after it has been used.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] [PR release

Preflight Checklist\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:** confirmed in 8.0.1, 7.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.0.0\r\n* **Operating System:** Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI have a `BrowserView` that is configured to resize with the window. I have a `resize` handler on the `BrowserWindow` that in some cases calls `setBounds`/`setSize` to change the size of the window.\r\n\r\nI expect the `BrowserView` to resize with the window.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe `BrowserView` doesn't resize correctly and shrinks.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nDownload the quickstart app. Replace main.js with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { app, BrowserWindow, BrowserView } = require('electron')\r\n\r\nasync function createWindow() {\r\n  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ backgroundColor: \"#000\" });\r\n  const view = new BrowserView();\r\n  mainWindow.setBrowserView(view);\r\n\r\n  const contentBounds = mainWindow.getContentBounds();\r\n  view.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: contentBounds.width, height: contentBounds.height });\r\n  view.setAutoResize({ width: true, height: true });\r\n\r\n  await view.webContents.loadURL(\"https://google.com\");\r\n\r\n  mainWindow.once(\"maximize\", () => {\r\n    mainWindow.once(\"resize\", () => {\r\n      mainWindow.setSize(1000, 1000);\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        console.log(mainWindow.getBounds()); // logs what it used to be at {x: 914, y: 62, width: 800, height: 600}\r\n        console.log(view.getBounds()); // bounds are not resized correctly: {x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 145}\r\n      }, 1000);\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\napp.on('ready', createWindow)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `npm start`, maximize the window to set up the `resize` handler, and then unmaximize it.\r\n\r\nObserve all the black space in the window where you would expect to see the browser view (google).\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is how the window size doesn't increase to 1000x1000 and stays whatever size it was. It does look like the BrowserView size increases, and it ends up out of sync with the window.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue isn't about the BrowserView, but more about the window size not increasing.\r\n\r\n### Gif\r\n![browserview_resize_issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6374473/74377426-7a023c00-4da9-11ea-919a-708560c81d78.gif)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/22174/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/22174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
