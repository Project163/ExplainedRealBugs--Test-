So the text is unreadable.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nHave had this problem since installation.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21225957/47019620-265fee00-d175-11e8-979b-355265503a47.png)\r\n![code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21225957/47019622-265fee00-d175-11e8-947b-1d2260c7e04d.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\nI am facing this problem on both Atom and VS Code so I am presuming it to be related to Electron. This is happening on both light and dark themes. In fact there is no change in the menu bar colors for Adapta and Adapta-Nokto themes. I have read abt this issue on another thread here but it was last updated an year ago and mentions the problem being related to electron not having GTK3 support. I presume this has been achieved so I dont know what to do now.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15194/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
