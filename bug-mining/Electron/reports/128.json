Preflight Checklist\n\n- [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\n- [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/electron/electron/issues) for a bug report that matches the one I want to file, without success.\n\n### Electron Version\n\n36.0.0 and above \n\n### What operating system(s) are you using?\n\nUbuntu\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nUbuntu 25.04\n\n### What arch are you using?\n\nx86_64 \n\n### Last Known Working Electron version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Does the issue also appear in Chromium / Google Chrome?\n\nI don't know how to test\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThis makes the intent clearer:  \n   if either environment variable is truthy, skip local checksums\n\n\n\n``` checksums: (process.env.electron_use_remote_checksums || process.env.npm_config_electron_use_remote_checksums) ? undefined : require('./checksums.json'), ```\n\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThere is a logical bug in   _install.js_   line 47  where the environment variable check for _electron_use_remotechecksums_     doesn't work correctly due to operator precedence \n\n\n\n\n\nThe ternary operator (?:) has lower precedence than the nullish coalescing operator (??), so the code is evaluated as:\n\n\n\n\n``` checksums: (process.env.electron_use_remote_checksums ?? process.env.npm_config_electron_use_remote_checksums) ? undefined : require('./checksums.json') ```\n\n\n- If either variable is set to a truthy value, it uses remote checksums \n- But the logic is confusing and not what was likely intended\n\n\n\n### Testcase Gist URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
