Electron Version: 3.0.0-beta.1\r\n* Operating System (Platform and Version): macOS 10.13 (but all others seem affected, too)\r\n* Last known working Electron version: 2.0.x\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nSpellchecking should work: After calling `webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider` with a given provider, that provider's `spellCheck()` method should be called.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nCalling `webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider` seems to have no effect - the provider is simply never called.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nClone the repo below and start the app. The spellcheck provider is configured to log each input word. However, it appears that `spellCheck` is never called.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/felixrieseberg/electron-3-spellcheck\r\ncd electron-3-spellcheck\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start || electron .\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nornagon","id":172800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon","html_url":"https://github.com/nornagon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nornagon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/13608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/13608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
