Either the initiator needs to be set in those cases, or your commit needs to be rolled back or modified.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/358439283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pfrazee","id":1270099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1270099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/pfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1429122017,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQyOTEyMjAxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/1429122017","actor":{"login":"tarruda","id":842846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Mjg0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda","html_url":"https://github.com/tarruda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-17T20:45:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1429122018,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MjkxMjIwMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/events/1429122018","actor":{"login":"tarruda","id":842846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Mjg0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda","html_url":"https://github.com/tarruda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-17T20:45:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/359506453","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11657#issuecomment-359506453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/11657","id":359506453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTUwNjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"pfrazee","id":1270099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1270099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/pfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T17:47:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T17:47:13Z","body":"Would

main reason I added https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/6b2ddc481477f6311cd3d8994c2421a2d1540823 is to allow `interceptStreamProtocol('https')` to modify/delegate requests to `electron.net`. Without this commit, invoking `electron.net` while intercepting http/https will result in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nIn any case, my approach to breaking the infinite loop was was kinda hacky and needs to be fixed. A possible solution is to put `URLRequest` pointers created by `electron.net` in a weak set that is checked by `MaybeCreateJob`. I will send a PR with this fix later this week.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/359543776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tarruda","id":842846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Mjg0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda","html_url":"https://github.com/tarruda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarruda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/359546043","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11657#issuecomment-359546043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/11657","id":359546043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTU0NjA0Mw==","user":{"login":"pfrazee","id":1270099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1270099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/pfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T19:58:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T19:58:08Z","body":"Ok
