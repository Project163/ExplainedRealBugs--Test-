Electron version: 1.6.7\r\n* Operating system: Mac OS X 10.10.5 and Windows 8.1\r\n\r\nI realize 1.6.7 is still in beta but thought I should report a memory leak I am seeing...  in a simple app that does window.open with every new window opened the memory keeps growing and is never released when the sub-windows get closed.\r\n\r\nThe demo repo is committed here: https://github.com/lneir/electron-memory-leak\r\n\r\nTo repo.\r\n1. git clone https://github.com/lneir/electron-memory-leak.git\r\n2. npm i\r\n3. npm run start\r\n4. in the main window click the open window button 5 times.\r\nNotice: the memory goes very high (approx 500 Mbytes) because each sub-window is allocating a big chunk of memory.\r\n5. now close all the open windows.\r\n\r\nResult: the memory of the renderer process stays very high\r\nExpected: memory to go back to original before all sub-windows were opened.\r\n\r\nNote: This does not happen on electron 1.4.16 but only appears to be a problem in electron 1.6.7.  \r\nNote: Also the problem seems to be related to the having preload enabled\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/9191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/9191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
