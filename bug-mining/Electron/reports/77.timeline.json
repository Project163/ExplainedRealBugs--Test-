is a race condition between DidCreateScriptContext and another navigation occuring in the main process. If the navigation occurs while the preload script is running, the same process is re-used.  This ensures that any pending navigations are completely removed / ignored when we trigger a new navigation.\r\n\r\nRefs #17576\r\n\r\nPlease note that although this refs #17576 it does not completely fix that issue, it makes it way harder to occur but it could still occur.  This is the quick fix, I'll be following up with another patch later to fix this / patch over this in the NavigationController impl in Chromium.\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes:  Fixed issue where preload scripts would sometimes run twice in the same process in different contexts resulting in broken native node module

Native modules in Electron\r\n\r\nLoading native modules in Electron has always been tricky.  It's a pain to rebuild, to link to the right `node.lib/dll`, and to ensure your `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` is correct.  And there's another problem behind the scenes that most users have never had to deal with: Node doesn't let you load multiple instances of a native module in the same process, even in different v8 contexts.  Imagine this scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Load https://google.com in BrowserWindow\r\n    * Process is launched.\r\n    * Preload script runs and loads native module X\r\n2. Load https://google.com/foo in BrowserWindow\r\n    * Chromium decides to reuse the process\r\n    * Preload script runs and loads native module X\r\n    * FAILURE - native module X loaded twice in the same process\r\n\r\nWe address this in Electron by patching Chromium to create a new process for **every** navigation.  This mostly works but still has a few edge cases (e.g. #4025, #12045, #17576) and a few side effects:\r\n* We lose all the performance gains from the Chromium plz-navigate changes :cry: \r\n* We have strange behavior with `window.open` and `window.opener` as we force child windows into separate processes sometimes. :cry: \r\n* Our patches occasionally have regressions because this isn't a process model that Chromium accepts / tests. :cry: \r\n\r\nWe've always thought \"wouldn't it be cool if we could change this\". Now, with Node 12's [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html), we see a way to do that.\r\n\r\n### Worker Threads\r\n\r\nNode ran into the same issue when they added worker threads: native modules could not be loaded in multiple workers.  Node solved this by introducing the concept of [\"Context Aware\"](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html#addons_context_aware_addons) native modules.  This is how native modules tell Node that they are safe to be loaded in multiple `v8::Context`s.  [Nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) has a handy helper ([`NAN_MODULE_WORKER_ENABLED`](https://github.com/nodejs/nan/pull/792)) for doing this.\r\n\r\nContext Aware modules and NAPI modules can be instantated multiple times in Node even without our patched process model. As they become more common, our patches will bring less benefit and be more redundant.\r\n\r\n### What does this mean for Electron?\r\n\r\nRight now, nothing. However, at some point in the future -- probably in a few major versions -- we intend to remove our process model patches. At that point, any native Node modules loaded in the renderer process **must** be either NAPI or Context Aware.\r\n\r\nThis won't happen tomorrow. It probably won't happen this year. But it will happen, so if you're using or maintaining a native module, you should start looking at the work to mark it as Context Aware. For lots of modules it's as easy as replacing `NODE_MODULE` with `NAN_MODULE_WORKER_ENABLED`. For modules that require cleanup, it can be more involved.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering why we're changing something that (mostly) works? The main reasons are:\r\n* **Performance**.  If we don't restart the renderer for every navigation, certain same-site navigations will be **much faster** than before. :smile:\r\n* **Security**.  When we follow Chromium's process model, we benefit from all the the optimizations and decisions they have made around Site Isolation and related initiatives. :smile: \r\n* **Maintenance**.  Our patches are not easy to keep working, especially as Chromium makes more and more process model performance improvements and optimizations.  Removing the patches removes a large maintenance burden. :smile: \r\n\r\n### What does this look like for Native Module X?\r\n\r\nThe amount of work to become \"Context Aware\" will be different for every module.  For native modules that act as proxies for native getters and setters -- i.e. they just expose JS apis to acccess native APIs -- it's normally as easy as adding a `NAN_MODULE_WORKER_ENABLED` declaration.  You can find an example of that in [this pull request](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar/pull/182/files).\r\n\r\nSome modules will need to do cleanup when the context is destroyed to ensure the module doesn't leaking memory or to cause crashes.  You can add hooks to clean up after yourself with `node::AddEnvironmentCleanupHook`  A minimal example of this can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/CharlieHess/node-mac-notifier/pull/32/files).\r\n\r\n### Timeline\r\n\r\n* Land the `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` option in Electron 6\r\n* Have the first deprecation warning land in Electron 7 for non-context aware native modules\r\n* Have a deprecation warning land in Electron 8 for the default value of `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` to switch\r\n* Switch the default value of `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` to `true` in Electron 9\r\n* Deprecate the ability to change `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` in Electron 10\r\n* Remove the ability to change `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` in Electron
