Electron version: 1.6.5\r\n* Operating system: OSX\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**\r\n\r\n- Set a more useful ```filename``` in the throwed error on the window object for identify where it happened (usefull)\r\n\r\n- The result/promise is never resolved now. Maybe it should get a callback with error argument and reject the promise exactly in this case?\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n\r\nThe documentation requires a better overview where/how to catch errors. Additionally some other information to understand the working of the different contexts.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n| Location | Unhandled errors | Available modules*** | Exposed variables**** |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| preload.js | ? | ? | ? |\r\n| executeJavaScript()* | ? | ? | ? |\r\n| page scripts _5)_ | window error handler** | ? | ? |\r\n\r\n*) webContents.executeJavaScript function\r\n**) ```window.addEventListener('error', function(errorEvent) {})``` or ```window.onerror = function(...) {}```\r\n***) which modules can be imported by using the ```require``` global function\r\n****) In the global context (can be the window object)\r\n_5)_ all scripts which is executed on the page or it resources\r\n\r\n**Web preferences which alter things:**\r\n\r\n| Web preference | default | How it alter things |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| sandbox | false | describe here... |\r\n| contextIsolation | false | describe here... |\r\n| nodeIntegration | true | describe here... |\r\n| javascript | false | if false then: all javascript execution is prevented |\r\n| webSecurity | false | if false then: describe here... |\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIf you use **executeJavaScript** it's difficult to catch the error which occurs in the passed javascript.\r\n\r\n#### In renderer\r\n```window.addEventListener('error', ...)``` is catching the error but the it's limited to the following:\r\n```\r\ncolumn:   0\r\nerror:    null\r\nfilename: \r\nline:     0\r\nmessage:  Script error\r\n```\r\nThis changes if I set it to ```webSecurity``` to ```false``` then I get:\r\n```\r\ncolumn:   7\r\nerror: \r\nfilename: \r\nline:     1\r\nmessage:  Uncaught Error: this is my exception\r\n```\r\nSo the problem is now, webSecurity is **disabled**, I think this is the best thing to do. And the **filename** is even now empty, I even now have no clue where it happened.\r\n\r\n#### Trough the debugger\r\nI attached and registered the debugger with the domains: ```Debugger.enable``` and ```Log.enable```\r\n\r\n```Log.entryAdded``` is never received for errors in ```executeJavaScript``` code.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nuse the options above then:\r\n```JS\r\nwebContents.executeJavaScript('throw new Error(\"this is my exception\")')\r\n```\r\nSame for syntax error or others...\r\n\r\nIn all examples the start options are (+ changes are described):\r\nStart options: ```webSecurity: true, nodeIntegration: false, sandbox: false```\r\nYes, this is almost the default config except nodeIntegration.\r\n\r\nThis is not related to the new ```sandbox``` function, it's false - in sandbox mode it's broken entirely:
