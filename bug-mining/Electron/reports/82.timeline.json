Description of Change\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18805.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if an app was running of the same name in Applications when `app.moveToApplicationsFolder()` was called, we would assume that meant it was the _same_ app, so we would quit this one and focus the other app, while returning true. Given nontrivial potential for naming clashes, this seems to be a potentially dangerous assumption to make as demonstrated by the above error.\r\n\r\nThis PR thus changes that behavior to throw an error indicating the naming conflict, and return false to indicate no such move occurred.\r\n\r\ncc @MarshallOfSound \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Description of Change\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18805.\r\n\r\nWe want to keep default move conflict handling behavior in that it's still what most users would expect, but there exist edge cases in which users may not want to be forced into that behavior.\r\n\r\nThis thus introduces an optional conflict handler that allows developers access to more granular move actions. They could now allow the user to choose whether to delete an existing app in favor of the current one being moved, or whether to quit the current app and focus on the existing one should it both exist _and_ be running. I added a fair amount of new documentation outlining this behavior, but if there are things users may benefit from seeing examples of or nuances that should be added please leave feedback!\r\n\r\ncc @MarshallOfSound @deepak1556 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
