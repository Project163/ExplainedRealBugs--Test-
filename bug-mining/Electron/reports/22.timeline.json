for opening an issue! A few things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n- The issue tracker is only for bugs and feature requests.\r\n- Before reporting a bug, please try reproducing your issue against\r\n  the latest version of Electron.\r\n- If you need general advice, join our Slack: http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Electron version: 1.7.1\r\n* Operating system: Mint 18\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n```javascript\r\nconst electron = require('electron');\r\nconst { app, Menu, Tray} = require('electron')\r\nconst ipc = electron.ipcMain;\r\nlet tray;\r\nlet mainWindow;\r\nconst iconFile = `${__dirname}/images/icon.png`;\r\n\r\nconst shouldQuit = app.makeSingleInstance(function(commandLine, workingDirectory) {\r\n    // Someone tried to run a second instance, we should focus our window\r\n    if (mainWindow) {\r\n        mainWindow.show();\r\n    }\r\n    return true;\r\n});\r\nconsole.log(`shouldQuit: ${shouldQuit}`)\r\nif (shouldQuit) {\r\n    app.quit();\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<!-- What do you think should happen? -->\r\nI would like to keep the old process and kill the new one. Right now it kills the old and creates a new.\r\nOnly one. that's right, but I want to keep the old one.\r\n\r\nBesides, ```shouldQuit``` is almost always false.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIt works, but wrong. It doesnt keep the exsiting, it quits the old one and starts a new one. \r\n\r\n<!-- What actually happens? -->\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n\r\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run.\r\n\r\nYou can fork https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start and include a link to the branch with your changes.\r\n\r\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\r\n\r\n  $ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\r\n  $ npm install\r\n  $ npm start || electron
