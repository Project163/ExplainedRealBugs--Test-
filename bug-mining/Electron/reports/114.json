It only happens on *one* of the devices I own, *all* others are fine, but this one does not handle these new versions, while older ones work. This must have been introduced somewhere in [these commits between those releases](https://github.com/electron/electron/compare/v20.0.0-beta.8...v20.0.0-beta.9).\n\n### Testcase Gist URL\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/\n\n### Additional Information\n\nRunning electron with `gdb` does not give a lot of info, unless I'm running it incorrectly, please see below and let me know if this should be done differently:\r\n```gdb\r\njelmerro ~/electron-quick-start (master)$ gdb --args node node_modules/.bin/electron .\r\nGNU gdb (GDB) Fedora 12.1-1.fc35\r\nCopyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\r\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\r\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\r\nType \"show copying\" and \"show warranty\" for details.\r\nThis GDB was configured as \"x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu\".\r\nType \"show configuration\" for configuration details.\r\nFor bug reporting instructions, please see:\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/>.\r\nFind the GDB manual and other documentation resources online at:\r\n    <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/>.\r\n\r\nFor help, type \"help\".\r\nType \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\r\nReading symbols from node...\r\n\r\nThis GDB supports auto-downloading debuginfo from the following URLs:\r\nhttps://debuginfod.fedoraproject.org/ \r\nEnable debuginfod for this session?
