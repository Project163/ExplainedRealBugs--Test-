been having this issue for quite some time now and decided to make an issue to see if I'm the only one experiencing this.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhenever I select my monitor as an audio output device, all caprine sounds still output through my internal speakers. So if I mute my monitor sound (when the monitor is the default audio device), it will still play sounds through the internal Macbook speakers.\r\n\r\nI tested if it was any other tool I'm using (MonitorControl would be a possible candidate for causing issues) but it wasn't. I'm thinking this might be an electron bug? It only seems to happen with my monitor, I tested it with my Airpods and it seemed to be fine. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Set monitor as default audio device (mine uses displayport)\r\n2. Mute monitor sound\r\n3. Trigger notification\r\n--> The sound will still output through internal Macbook speakers.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this won't be reproducible for everyone, but I'm pretty sure it's either electron or caprine. \r\n\r\nAnyone else experiencing this? Any ideas what it could be? Let me know if you want my to test some other stuff.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nCaprine 2.30.2 (2.30.2.1338)\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.14.4\r\n\r\nI've been having this issue for several macOS and Caprine versions though (as long as I can remember)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/caprine/issues/840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/caprine/issues/840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/519763324","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12311#issuecomment-519763324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/12311","id":519763324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTc2MzMyNA==","user":{"login":"sofianguy","id":2138661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2138661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy","html_url":"https://github.com/sofianguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofianguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T03:27:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T03:27:01Z","body":"Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.\r\n\r\nThe version of Electron you reported this on has been superseded by newer releases. \r\n\r\nIf you're still experiencing this issue in Electron v4.2.x or later, please add a comment specifying the version you're testing with and any other new information that a maintainer trying to reproduce the issue should know.\r\n\r\nI'm setting the `blocked/need-info` label for the above reasons.
