On MacOS (v11.5.2 Intel x64) disabling `backgroundThrottling` causes `requestAnimatingFrames` to continue to work for all 3 cases -- occluded, minmized, and hidden. This is the reason I think this might be a bug on Windows.\r\n\r\n### Testcase Gist URL\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/aluo-lmi/e8be4e6f23f5eca831fad332a810f99f\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nSteps for repro on gist:\r\n1. Start gist in electron (fiddle), open dev console and pop it out -> observe the `tick` being logged twice per second as callbacks to `requestAnimationFrame` calls\r\n2. Occlude the window, minimize the window, or click `Hide for 5s` -> observe the `tick` stops being logged in all 3 cases\r\n3. Click `Toggle background throttling` button\r\n4. Occlude or minimize the window -> observe the `tick` does not stop being logged\r\n5. Click `Hide for 5s` -> On Windows, observe the `tick` stops being logged during the 5s the window is hidden, indicating the `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks are being blocked. On Mac, observe the `tick` continue to be logged indicating they are not.","closed_by":{"login":"jkleinsc","id":609052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc","html_url":"https://github.com/jkleinsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkleinsc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/31016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/31016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
