in ^4.0.0, this still worked.\r\n\r\n<!--  As an open source project with a dedicated but small maintainer team, it can sometimes take a long time for issues to be addressed so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Preflight Checklist\r\n<!-- Please ensure you've completed the following steps by replacing [ ] with [x]-->\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n* [x] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that this project adheres to.\r\n* [x] I have searched the issue tracker for an issue that matches the one I want to file, without success.\r\n\r\n### Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * 5.0.2\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * Windows 10 x64 latest\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**\r\n  * 4.2.2\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe spellchecker is correctly called with contractions (and their parts)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe spellchecker is now only called with the parts of the contractions.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nJust use the spellcheck API anywhere.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nIn ^4.0.0, the spellcheck API would call the spellchecker with first the contraction and then its parts (i.e. for `couldn't` it would be called with `couldn't`, `couldn`, `t` in order). The new ^5.0.0 API calls the spellchecker with an array of just the parts (i.e. for `couldn't` it would be called with `['couldn', 't']`. Therefore, it is now completely impossible to correctly handle contractions.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this. <3","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18459/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/18459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
