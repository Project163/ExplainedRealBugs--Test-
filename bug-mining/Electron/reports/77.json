Issue Details\r\n\r\n* **Electron Version:**\r\n  * 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x\r\n* **Operating System:**\r\n  * All\r\n* **Last Known Working Electron version:**:\r\n  * 2.x\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen navigations occur, a new process should be created for the navigation.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nWhen a navigation occurs _during_ a preloads scripts execution the same process is re-used as Chromium does not think the navigation has been committed yet.  This causes a memory leak and all native node modules to break.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nFiddle: https://gist.github.com/MarshallOfSound/c89aa0037c3da114d44aa3a2d1a0fc24\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6634592/55097842-eb45dd00-5079-11e9-99bf-d49c0d997bca.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see here there are three navigation loads, the second and the third one actually have the same process ID (and are running in the same process)","closed_by":{"login":"MarshallOfSound","id":6634592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzQ1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6634592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound","html_url":"https://github.com/MarshallOfSound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarshallOfSound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/17576/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
