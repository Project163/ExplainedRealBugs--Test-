When I move the mouse outside of the window area, the `div` keeps its hover style. It should actually go back to its normal style. Presumable the mouseleave event was \"swallowed\".\n\nFor a demonstration video see here: https://www.screenr.com/4M0N\n\nIt happens using the frameless view **and** using the windows frame view. Even though the latter is more difficult to reproduce (move the mouse faster).\n\nYou can reproduce it with this sample code:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>mouseleave</title>\n\n        <style>\n            .box {\n                position: absolute;\n                top: 0;\n                right: 0;\n                bottom: 0;\n                left: 10%;\n            }\n            .box:hover {\n                background-color: red;\n            }\n        </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n        <div class=\"box\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nMy setup:\nWindows ~~**8.1**~~ **7**\natom-shell **0.15.7**\n","closed_by":{"login":"codebytere","id":2036040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzYwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2036040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere","html_url":"https://github.com/codebytere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebytere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/611/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
