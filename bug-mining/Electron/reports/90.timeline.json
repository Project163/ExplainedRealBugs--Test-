Description of Change\r\nFix incorrect formatting in browser documentation.\r\n\r\nMissing backticks caused the docs parser to think that the return type\r\nof the `isEnabled` function was null, where it was supposed to be a\r\nboolean type.\r\n\r\nThe side effect of this was that the generated typescript typings were\r\nincorrect for this function.\r\n\r\nFixes #24409\r\n\r\n\r\n####
