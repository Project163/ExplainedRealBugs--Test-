version:**\r\n  * Unknown. Broken in `4-1-x` upwards.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPassing additional schemes on the command line, e.g. `--standard-schemes=foo,bar,mum`, should not affect other schemes, e.g. cors enabled schemes or secure schemes.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe schemes from earlier checks bleed into all the following switches checked.\r\n\r\nThis happens due to the \"splitted\" variable in `shell/app/atom_content_client.cc`'s `AtomContentClient::AddAdditionalSchemes()` being reused for each switch without being cleared first.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nOn the command line, add schemes for one of the argument switches handled in `AtomContentClient::AddAdditionalSchemes()`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTYwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/19911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
