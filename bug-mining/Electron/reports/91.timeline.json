Description of Change\r\n\r\npowerMonitor can't be used until the app is ready; however, on Linux, `powerMonitor.on()` was called as soon as lib/browser/api/power-monitor.ts was loaded.\r\n\r\nThis patch takes @vladimiry's [suggestion](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21716#issuecomment-572701025) of wrapping the calls in an app.on('ready') handler to prevent `powerMonitor.on()` from being called prematurely. It also adds an app.isReady() test in case powerMonitor is imported after the app is ready.\r\n\r\nNote about the caveat described there about possible sequencing errors from the lazy loading &mdash; I don't _think_ this is an issue, because `powerMonitor.on()` can't be called by user code before the app is ready, and power-monitor.ts' on-ready-handler is registered as soon as power-monitor.ts is loaded. I'd welcome a second opinion on that though.\r\n\r\nFixes #21716.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] PR title follows
