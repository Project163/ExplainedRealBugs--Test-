API \"setAutoResize\" of BrowserView. \r\nWhen BrowserWindow is resized, BrowserView should correctly auto-resize.\r\n```\r\nfunction createWindow() {\r\n  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\r\n    width: 800,\r\n    height: 600,\r\n    webPreferences: {}\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  const view = new BrowserView()\r\n\r\n  const [\r\n    width,\r\n    height\r\n  ] = mainWindow.getSize()\r\n\r\n  view.setBounds({\r\n    x: 0,\r\n    y: 0,\r\n    width,\r\n    height\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  mainWindow.addBrowserView(view)\r\n\r\n  view.setAutoResize({\r\n    width: true,\r\n    height: true,\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  view.webContents.loadURL('https://www.electronjs.org/')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe size of the BrowserView changes unexpectedly, causing it to no longer fit the BrowserWindow, and it is almost impossible to restore by resizing the window.\r\n![browserview_bug](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679d24c0-6939-4231-b798-73da79f7dcc6)\r\n\r\n\r\n###
