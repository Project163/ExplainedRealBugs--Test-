at":"2015-11-13T20:48:44Z","body":"I was able to create a new test case demonstrating the crash even with `event.preventDefault` -- https://gist.github.com/rprichard/5aed5b96e69cc22b66b8.  It uses the `request` npm package, so run `npm install` before running electron.\n\nI debugged the original test case, and here's what I learned:\n- When the `page-title-updated` handler closes the window in the original test case, it also immediately deallocates the `content::WebContentsImpl` object, which you can see in the original test case's stack backtrace.\n- In the original stack trace, `WebContentsImpl::UpdateTitle` calls `WebContentsImpl::UpdateTitleForEntry`, which ultimately segfaults.\n- In the new stack trace, `WebContentsImpl::UpdateTitle` calls `NavigationControllerImpl::GetEntryAtOffset`, which ultimately segfaults.\n\nHere's the code for `WebContentsImpl::UpdateTitle`:\n\n``` c++\n...\n  // TODO(evan): make use of title_direction.\n  // http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27094\n  if (!UpdateTitleForEntry(entry, title))\n    return;\n\n  // Broadcast notifications when the UI should be updated.\n  if (entry == controller_.GetEntryAtOffset(0))\n    NotifyNavigationStateChanged(INVALIDATE_TYPE_TITLE);\n}\n```\n\nThe `WebContentsImpl` object (i.e. `this`) has been deallocated, so reading the `this->controller_` field is reading dangling memory.\n\nThe fix needs to keep `WebContentsImpl` from being deallocated until the event handler finishes.\n\n(FWIW: to debug the code, I used gdb and placed breakpoints on places such as `content::WebContentsImpl::~WebContentsImpl`.  On Linux, `this` is `$rdx` on method entry.  I also compiled Electron with debug info (-g) by hacking it into the ninja build scripts.  I wanted to build Chromium with debug info, but my computer took too long, and I think the build also failed for some reason.)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/156552501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rprichard","id":1572855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1572855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard","html_url":"https://github.com/rprichard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/comments/156571929","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3380#issuecomment-156571929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/3380","id":156571929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjU3MTkyOQ==","user":{"login":"rprichard","id":1572855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1572855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard","html_url":"https://github.com/rprichard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprichard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T22:04:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T22:04:22Z","body":"@zcbenz
