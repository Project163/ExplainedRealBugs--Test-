Electron Version: 2.x, 3.x\r\n* Operating System (Platform and Version): Linux\r\n* Last known working Electron version:  1.8\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nI would expect the menubar's background color to use a background based on the GTK theme. Up to Electron 2.0 this used to work (albeit only for the light theme variant), see for example the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-22 11-20-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325102/41769175-b76bc922-760e-11e8-8b55-d0f7cc20fe0c.png)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nIn Electron 2.x and 3.x the menubar is always white. Using both the light and dark theme variant. \r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-22 11-19-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325102/41769298-1a69ad1e-760f-11e8-8643-99828bc77779.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-22 11-19-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325102/41769301-1fb9017a-760f-11e8-9993-6f479ffef826.png)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis is reproducible for me with Electron Quick Start.
