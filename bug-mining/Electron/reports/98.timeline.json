methods such as `on` defined, to listen to screen events such as `display-added`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n`remote.screen` does not have any defined EventEmitter methods\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nIn the devtools, inspect `require('electron').remote.screen` and notice that it does not have the `on` method defined\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nThere was a PR to address other `remote.screen` methods not being defined that was merged in 11.0.3 (https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26660), but it did not seem to address this
