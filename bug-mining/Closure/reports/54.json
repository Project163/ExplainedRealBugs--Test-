Please review and apply to closure-compiler.\r\n\r\nI did the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Added type \u0026quot;Image\u0026quot; to HTML5 drawImage method. This method accepts HTML\r\nImage elements but also images created by \u0026quot;new Image()\u0026quot;. Without this fix\r\nthe compiler throws an error because I can\u0027t pass \u0026quot;Image\u0026quot; to drawImage. An\r\nalternative fix would be letting Image extend HTMLImageElement (I\u0027m not\r\nsure if this is the real specification of Image).\r\n\r\n* Removed the unannotated Window.prototype.removeEventListener so Window\r\nuses the correctly annotated Node.prototype.removeEventListener instead.\r\n\r\n* Added type annotation to Element.prototype.tagName.\r\n\r\n* Added missing parameter and return value annotation to prompt function.","timestamp":1271496735,"attachments":[{"id":4708319678675259211,"fileName":"closurecompiler.patch","fileSize":1543}]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"Thanks for the patch!
