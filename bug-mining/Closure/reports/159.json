I created a servlet to dynamically compile Closure code.  It\u0027s a bit hacky at the moment though because I\u0027m calling CommandLineRunner in order to get the --manage_closure_dependencies functionality.  If JSModuleGraph.manageDependencies were public then I imagine that I could just call the compiler directly instead, which would be much cleaner.","timestamp":1318788189,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"This issue was closed by revision r1518.","timestamp":1318892369,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":1087854357883684208,"content":"Awesome.
