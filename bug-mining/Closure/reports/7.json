Can also be used in other\r\nsystems like Gradle, Buildr and Maven. It\u0027s not feature complete, but it\u0027s\r\na start. \r\n\r\nAdded a svn patch that includes two java files. Also you need to have\r\nant.jar (1.7.1 but works with older) into the lib directory to compile.\r\n\r\nAn example build.xml script is included.\r\n","timestamp":1262993886,"attachments":[{"id":-7688928661053693128,"fileName":"ant_compile_task.diff","fileSize":9101},{"id":6404646700869945702,"fileName":"build.xml","fileSize":751}]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"Cool!\r\n\r\nSo before we start, there\u0027s one bit of legal stuff we need to do. We need you to sign a \r\ncontributor license agreement. This agreement basically says \"I own the copyright on \r\nthis code, and it\u0027s ok if closure compiler uses it\".\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html\r\n\r\nYou can fill it out online or by mail. Please let me know if anything on that page is \r\nunclear, or if you have any questions about it.","timestamp":1262999452,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-3665918376126204756,"content":"Done.

That\u0027s a good question, and I\u0027m curious \r\nabout the answer. I\u0027m trying to find a lawyer to ask.\r\n\r\nAlso, I misspoke earlier. There\u0027s a second form. If your employer has rights to the \r\nwork you do, then you need to sign a corporate CLA.\r\nhttp://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html\r\nIf you have any doubts about whether or not you need to fill that one out, you should \r\nask your employer.","timestamp":1263004334,"attachments":[]},{"id":5,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"OK, I checked. It\u0027s ok if you used the email address at x3m.com in the form. checking \r\nif you need to do the corporate cla too is the only legal detail left.\r\n\r\nRobert has agreed to review this. We\u0027ll do the code review in Rietveld. I have not \r\nused Rietveld before, but I hear that it is very good. I can take care of the \r\nbookkeeping. It\u0027s late in Brooklyn (where I live), and I have to go for the weekend, \r\nso i\u0027ll set that up on Monday.\r\n\r\nwhat\u0027s the best way to have automated tests for ant tasks? We could just use the \r\nsample build.xml you wrote, but I wasn\u0027t sure if Ant had some other way to test them.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for contributing this!","timestamp":1263010322,"attachments":[]},{"id":6,"commenterId":-3665918376126204756,"content":"No need for a corporate CLA.
