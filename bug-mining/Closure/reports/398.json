What do you see instead?\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\nI expected output source map to be a transformed version of the input source map (the input file contains the \u0026quot;//# sourceMappingURL\u0026quot; pragma at the bottom). Instead, the input source map is ignored.\r\n\r\nThe transformation should at least preserve the original file names and line/column mappings, but it would also be very helpful to have an option for the sourcesContent field to be carried over and updated. I\u0027m using closure compiler to optimize the output of a custom compile-to-js language as you can tell from the input source map.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat version of the product are you using?
