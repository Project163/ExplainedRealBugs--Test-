What do you see instead?\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\nI expect the compiler not to change the functionality, so when I run the compiled code, I get both alerts. In reality, this is compiled to \u0026quot;alert(\u0027Done.\u0027);\u0026quot;, changing behavior.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat version of the product are you using?
