{"id":322,"status":"Fixed","summary":"Missing type for Location.prototype.replace in ie_dom.js","labels":["Type-Defect","Priority-Medium"],"stars":1,"commentCount":7,"comments":[{"id":0,"commenterId":4017014494417519328,"content":"The Location.prototype.replace method in ie_dom.js has no type information (And it looks like all the other stuff of Location.prototype is incomplete as well). So when compiling code like \r\n\r\n  window.location.replace(\u0026quot;someUrl\u0026quot;)\r\n\r\nends in a compiler warning:\r\n\r\n   ERROR - could not determine the type of this expression\r\n      window.location.replace(\u0026quot;someUrl\u0026quot;);\r\n\r\nA workaround is casting the replace method to the correct type:\r\n\r\n  (/** @type {function(string)} */ window.location.replace)(\u0026quot;someUrl\u0026quot;);\r\n\r\nTo fix this the type must be put into the ie_dom.js file. And maybe it is a good idea to add the missing types to all other members there as well.","timestamp":1295512062,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":1948758734812428220,"content":"I\u0027ll add the annotation","timestamp":1295546450,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":1948758734812428220,"content":"","timestamp":1295546464,"attachments":[]},{"id":3,"commenterId":1328304962299559429,"content":"This issue was closed by revision r788.","timestamp":1297907223,"attachments":[]},{"id":4,"commenterId":1948758734812428220,"content":"FYI:\r\n\r\nThis was rolled back due to breakage.
