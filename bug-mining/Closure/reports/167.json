There is a nice check whether the browser is Internet Explorer.

I know about ASCII output and reg. expressions which should be splitted with string concatenation. But the statement above is not a reg. expression. Why does \\v get replaced by \\u000b at all? Do you have a workaround for me? Is it a bug?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.","timestamp":1321627009,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":8173196008570380122,"content":"This is related to issue 395.
