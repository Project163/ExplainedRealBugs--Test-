Consider converting the ant task to use setDependencyOptions as part of this change, maybe making the createDependencyOption method part of the Compiler options so that logic is more widely available. \r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/browse/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/AbstractCommandLineRunner.java#270\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/browse/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ant/CompileTask.java#334\r\n\r\n\r\n","timestamp":1391030115,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":7730063706161723473,"content":"Here\u0027s an simple patch to enable this.
