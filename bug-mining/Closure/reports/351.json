I spent a few hours on it, but I don\u0027t know TypedScopeCreator well so I couldn\u0027t figure it out.\r\n\r\nBasically, for 2 or more levels of inheritance for interfaces, the compiler doesn\u0027t resolve them correctly if they\u0027re not declared in order. For classes it works fine. \r\n\r\nThis was uncovered by a google-internal project. It works correctly in the new type inference, but it\u0027s not ready to land, so it\u0027s probably better to fix it in the existing type inference as well.\r\n\r\nSee example below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/** @interface @extends {MidI} */\r\nfunction LowI() {}\r\n\r\n/** @interface @extends {HighI} */\r\nfunction MidI() {}\r\n\r\n/** @interface */\r\nfunction HighI() {}\r\n\r\n\r\n/** @constructor @extends {MidC} */\r\nfunction LowC() {}\r\n\r\n/** @constructor @extends {HighC} */\r\nfunction MidC() {}\r\n\r\n/** @constructor */\r\nfunction HighC() {}","timestamp":1395735820,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"sure, i\u0027ll take a look","timestamp":1395791834,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"just to clarify, the example with the constructors works fine. it\u0027s just the one with the interfaces that\u0027s broken. right?","timestamp":1395794791,"attachments":[]},{"id":3,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"http://codereview.appspot.com/80260043/","timestamp":1395796419,"attachments":[]},{"id":4,"commenterId":4865484112040790759,"content":"Thanks for looking into this!
