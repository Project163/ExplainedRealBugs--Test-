This results in a huge reduction in output file size versus --manage_closure_dependencies. However, when compiling a program that uses the Closure Library, base.js is also dropped because it does not explicitly provide \u0026quot;goog\u0026quot; with a call to goog.provide(). This results in programs that do not run because \u0026quot;goog\u0026quot; is undefined.\r\n\r\nWith --only_closure_dependencies, if base.js is passed a dependency to the compiler, shouldn\u0027t \u0026quot;goog\u0026quot; be implicitly provided and also considered as one of the closure entry points?","timestamp":1333936070,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"thanks for the report! this flag is still in the experimental stage, so bug reports like this are especially appreciated.","timestamp":1334092388,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"This issue was closed by revision r1890.","timestamp":1334185282,"attachments":[]}]}
