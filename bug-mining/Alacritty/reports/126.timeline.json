So, when you _leave_ Alacritty via Cmd-Tab, that modifier is effectively \"stuck,\" since your window lost focus while a modifier was held down.\r\n\r\nBoth the macOS and Wayland implementations seem to have used the same assumption.\r\n\r\nYou can replicate this by Cmd-Tabbing _into_ Alacritty, and typing. The Command key does not seem to be pressed when you do this. But when you Cmd-Tab _out_ of Alacritty and then restore focus to it (by mouse, or whatever) Alacritty behaves as if the Cmd modifier is still pressed from before.\r\n\r\nPR rust-windowing/winit#1381 seems to take a promising approach to solving this issue: if modifiers are depressed when either entering or leaving a window, an additional event is emulated; if entering the window, an event is sent with the current modifier state; and if leaving, an event is sent with an empty modifier state to reset the set of modifiers.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned PR seems, to me, to only be missing complementary implementations for macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA patch _could_ be implemented downstream, e.g. [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/a82df6ac4309f16bd1c75d13f1f4f1b9f79582eb/alacritty/src/event.rs#L559-L572), perhaps by resetting the `modifiers` field on `Processor<N>` to `ModifiersState::empty()` if the window lost focus? If a fix is coming upstream, though, is it better to just

a mac program called Alfred that has a feature for [auto expanding text snippets](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/) that has worked in all previous alacritty versions I've used but now breaks in 0.4.1.\r\n\r\nI have a number of snippets setup, in the logs I'm using the snippet `;cl` to expand to `console.log()`.\r\n\r\nIn 0.4.0:\r\n`;cl` expands to `console.log()`\r\n\r\nIn 0.4.1:\r\n`;cl` expands to `v`\r\n\r\nAlfred is closed source so I don't know exactly what it is doing but when it auto expands I believe it's \r\n\r\n1. Copying the snippet to the clipboard\r\n2. Sending a series of simulated key presses to do a `CMD-v` paste\r\n3. Repositioning the cursor via simulated key presses\r\n4.

System\r\n\r\nOS: macOS\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.4.2-dev (4cc6421)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Alacritty.app\r\n1. Switch to some other app, preferably a \"heavy\" one like a web browser or Slack or Spotify, and click around\r\n1. Using the app switcher, hover over alacritty for a second, and start holding `w` key right after letting go of command key (which should activate alacritty, but not show the `w` characters being  typed). This should close the app.\r\n\r\nI've tried out these steps multiple times, and it's *almost* consistent. The weird part is that this doesn't happen (at least reliably) when switching back from some applications. There doesn't seem to be a crash as such, and I noticed a  `UserEvent(ExitEvent)` getting logged before the event loop gets removed. This sounds like some upstream bug in windowing/event-management, but I thought I'd open it here first to rule out any edge cases in the app.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is relavant, but I've tried this with both Slack and Spotify, with hardware acceleration turned on and off without any difference in alacritty's behaviour.\r\n\r\nLog generated when following the above steps: https://gist.github.com/239954c52d067d8eaecc28a2bd71d61d.\r\n\r\nI'll put up a video if I can get the recording uploaded somewhere. The one I took is very rudimentary and didn't have any keycode printout, so I'm not sure how useful it'd be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/579113896","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3188#issuecomment-579113896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3188","id":579113896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTExMzg5Ng==","user":{"login":"RobertAudi","id":87562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi","html_url":"https://github.com/RobertAudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertAudi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T07:21:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T07:21:44Z","body":"Until
