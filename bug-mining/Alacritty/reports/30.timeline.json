is an RFC PR to fix #721, my first attempt at modifying a Rust application that people use and my first foray into Alacritty's code. As such there are a few issues with how it's implemented — I'm not happy with how the scrolling state is duplicated across `event::Processor` and `input::ActionContext` (although this might be appropriate?), the names I've used are terrible and I've added a dumb implementation of the state function to what is as far as I can tell a stub implementation of `ActionContext` for testing purposes.
