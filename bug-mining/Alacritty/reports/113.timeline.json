is not the only option, it's complicated in Linux 🙂 \r\n\r\nFor example, [eosrei/emojione-color-font](https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font) that you mentioned is a custom build of EmojiOne to add support for Firefox via SVGinOT technology, but the official [Ranks/emojione](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/tree/master/extras/fonts) has [emojione-android.ttf](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/extras/fonts/emojione-android.ttf) which provides color emoji via CBDT/CBLC technology for all Chrome-based apps, as well as all GTK+ apps if you install a patched cairo.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the font from the official repo consists of the EmojiOne v3, which is a redesigned version of older EmojiOne v2, and the community is [working right now](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/issues/477) to add the latest Unicode 4.0 emojis in the font.\r\n\r\nSo, in summary it would be a pity to support only SVGinOT stack.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 1:** CBDT/CBLC fonts seem to work in Firefox as well now.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2:** cairo merged the patch in upstream, so it also supports CBDT/CBLC. In other words, CBDT/CBLC technology is supported almost in all apps now on Linux. Alacritty should support it too.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 3:** With no configuration from my side, Sakura terminal now supports CBDT/CBLC technology to show colorful emojis (do they just use cairo?):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177900/32016435-4322e6ce-b9c4-11e7-9753-be2941fa95fd.png)\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/299800986/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"max-baz","id":1177900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz","html_url":"https://github.com/max-baz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/299881395","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/153#issuecomment-299881395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/153","id":299881395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTg4MTM5NQ==","user":{"login":"PaulBGD","id":3516420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTY0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3516420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulBGD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulBGD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-08T14:24:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T14:24:30Z","body":"Huh, just hearing about CBDT/CBLC.
