a\r\n`ReceivedCharacter` event.\r\n\r\n[`ReceivedCharacter` docs](https://docs.rs/glutin/latest/glutin/event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.ReceivedCharacter) say:\r\n\r\n> ReceivedCharacter(char)\r\n>\r\n> The window received a unicode character.\r\n>\r\n> See also the `Ime` event for more complex character sequences.\r\n\r\nAnd the [`Ime` docs](https://docs.rs/glutin/latest/glutin/event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.Ime) say:\r\n\r\n> An event from an input method.\r\n>\r\n> Note: You have to explicitly enable this event using\r\n> `[Window::set_ime_allowed]`.\r\n\r\nI am not using IME, and I do not see any changes in the calls to\r\n`set_ime_allowed()`, but could it be still related?\r\n\r\nI may try compiling a local version and bisecting changes between rc1 and\r\nrc2, but do not realy on me, as I've never done it before and not sure how\r\nmuch effort would it

`Alt` - it is a regression in `winit`, see https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2504 for details.\r\nThere is an attempt in `winit` to match Windows keyboard handing semantics better, but it is, unfortunately, incompatible with Unix and MacOS semantics.\r\nCurrently, the suggested solution is to revert the change.\r\nMy guess is that it will take some time for the change in `winit` and the next RC of Alactritty will include the fix.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to downgrade `winit` to `0.27.2`.\r\nBut the bump PR (https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/6326) says that it fixes two issues.\r\nAnd as `winit` seems to be working on a fix, it does not seem like a reasonable thing to do at the moment.\r\n\r\n`s` issue should be unrelated, as the change in `winit` only affected handling of `Alt` on Windows.\r\n@Palpatineli, you may want to create a new issue with regard to `s`, and provide event logs, as suggested in the new issue template.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1268966327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilya-bobyr","id":694419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDQxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/694419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr","html_url":"https://github.com/ilya-bobyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilya-bobyr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7528475678,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85Shm_tzwAAAAHAu2we","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7528475678","actor":{"login":"Palpatineli","id":224065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDA2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/224065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli","html_url":"https://github.com/Palpatineli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-05T20:56:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7528475686,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85Shm_tzwAAAAHAu2wm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7528475686","actor":{"login":"Palpatineli","id":224065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDA2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/224065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli","html_url":"https://github.com/Palpatineli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palpatineli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-05T20:56:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1268983318","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6356#issuecomment-1268983318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6356","id":1268983318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85LoyYW","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"cre
