If the alacritty window is not focused, then, after resizing, the new area is not filled in by alacritty. This only happens when the window is resized quickly.\r\n\r\nI have traced this bug to the following lines: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/56a69c0bfe5742aeda1c4942b748f5a842ce6773/alacritty/src/window_context.rs#L321-L325\r\n\r\nThis flag is set in https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/56a69c0bfe5742aeda1c4942b748f5a842ce6773/alacritty/src/display/mod.rs#L1109-L1111\r\n\r\nHowever, there is nothing in that callback that would trigger alacritty to actually do any drawing. I believe that, in this callback, there should be something that triggers glutin to re-emit the `RedrawEventsCleared` event, e.g. a call to `request_redraw`. But I'm not sure how to best implement this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, why this only happens in multi-window mode I don't know.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1146101566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mahkoh","id":1882250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODIyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1882250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh","html_url":"https://github.com/mahkoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1146203515","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6069#issuecomment-1146203515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6069","id":1146203515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85EUa17","user":{"login":"mahkoh","id":1882250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODIyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1882250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh","html_url":"https://github.com/mahkoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahkoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-03T17:30:37Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T18:52:55Z","body":"This might actually be a bug in mesa.\r\n\r\n1. make_current causes mesa to allocate buffers for the current window size\r\n2.

wonder if we can send something that does just `RedrawEventsCleared` + Move the `current_context` logic after window resize but before renderer resize?\r\n\r\nSo we won't have that dirty, but will have an event to wakeup the event loop in advance. Though, I'd have to test your logic a bit to understand whether it fixes or not. It's just in your particular issue the problem was that I think we've already done processing events for the rest of the windows for which the frame callback got triggered, so it doesn't woke up properly in your particular case, just forwarding event should do that + we should ensure that the buffer is new, which we can do by moving context related stuff in `handle_update`. I'll get to it tomorrow though, but thanks for your input, it does help a lot.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1146395433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1146570949","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6069#issuecomment-1146570949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6069","id":1146570949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85EV0jF","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-04T08:52:48Z","updated_at":"2022-06-04T08:52:48Z","body":"@mahkoh
