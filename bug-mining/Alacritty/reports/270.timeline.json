command.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1871337644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mo-st","id":95215142,"node_id":"U_kgDOBazeJg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95215142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st","html_url":"https://github.com/mo-st","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mo-st/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11352468672,"node_id":"CE_lADOAxkop856r3tjzwAAAAKkqOzA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/11352468672","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-28T17:57:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11352468849,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop856r3tjzwAAAAKkqO1x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/11352468849","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"81df32af60147941c7d6005cf55ffd14c9665734","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/81df32af60147941c7d6005cf55ffd14c9665734","created_at":"2023-12-28T17:57:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1872536233","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7473#issuecomment-1872536233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7473","id":1872536233,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85vnKKp","user":{"login":"aloispichler","id":45781387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzgxMzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45781387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler","html_url":"https://github.com/aloispichler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloispichler/re

Each keybinding is converted to a toml entry like so:\r\n```toml\r\n[[keyboard.bindings]]\r\nchars = \"\\u001B[13;5u\"\r\nkey = \"Return\"\r\nmods = \"Control\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can very easily verify this yourself by saving the snippet you've posted into a `file.yml`, and running `alacritty migrate -c file.yml`, which should create `file.toml`. The `-c` option is documented in `alacritty migrate --help`.\r\n\r\nMind that the problem described in this issue is strictly tied to importing non-existent files. This appears to have been solved, a fix should be available in 0.13.1 (whenever that is released), and until then it's very easy to avoid the problem manually by passing the `-i` flag as I described, or getting rid of the redundant import entries from your config, or using the development branch where the fix is present. It's not really clear from your explanation if our problems are at all related.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1872540362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"randoragon","id":46251339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjUxMzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46251339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon","html_url":"https://github.com/randoragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randoragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11407316643,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop856r3tjzwAAAAKn7daj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/11407316643","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eeac024edbdb478947093c2ce372ff0caeaf209f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/eeac024edbdb478947093c2ce372ff0caeaf209f","created_at":"2024-01-06T05:57:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11407551038,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop856r3tjzwAAAAKn8Wo-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/11407551038","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"047152acb891c395d4280e4bbdc9e6df9eb23f0e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/047152acb891c395d4280e4bbdc9e6df9eb23f0e","created_at":"2024-01-06T07:59:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12920478318,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop856r3tjzwAAAAMCHtpu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/12920478318","actor":{"login":"xiaogaozi","id":149645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTY0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaogaozi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogaozi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.co
