also find the offset placement of the initial window after resizing for font metric, to be irritating. Indeed the font metrics should be available first (as noted in the comments inside the source code), _then_ window dimensions and correct position can be determined, before the window gets mapped to the screen, thereby allowing the WM to put it in the correct spot.\r\n\r\nI've been perusing the sourcecode to see if I can help here, as I've done some amount of simple window programming in C against xlib, but Rust is brand new to me and I'm rather lost trying to follow the code. Therefore I can only offer some thoughts on this issue:\r\n\r\nCLI tools like xdpyinfo, query the X Server for data; if there's an X server running, there's a $DISPLAY which can be queried for DPI info and other stuff; DISPLAY can be queried before making any windows, so shouldn't need to create a (hidded or unmapped or invisible) window just to query it for info about its DISPLAY.\r\n\r\nBut in line with what jwilm wrote above on 07 Jan., seems to me it should be something for Glutin to deal with, not Alacritty. If Glutin supplied the DPI early on, Alacritty could compute size and window placement before mapping, negating need of a resize.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile:\r\n2) assuming that font size will not typically be changed once the user has a font he/she is happy with, perhaps the glyph-cache (and/or associated metric data) could be saved in ~/.config/alacritty or similar location. Then, upon startup, Alacritty could see if the font & size is the same as it was last time (compare saved cache data against font in config file); if it is, window dimensions and therefore position, can be already known before mapping. But if the font/size HAVE changed since last execution, we're back at square one, with a resize needed that will result in the window placement being \"off\" after resize. Again, as mentioned in comments in source code: ideally this stuff be calculated before the window gets created/mapped, then at least the WM can place it just once, in the right spot.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/385145016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sas-18","id":38713922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzEzOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38713922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18","html_url":"https://github.com/Sas-18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sas-18/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"noctuid","id":4250696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTA2OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4250696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid","html_url":"https://github.com/noctuid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noctuid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T23:16:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T23:16:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/noctuid/tdrop/issues/50","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/noctuid/tdrop","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/noctuid/tdrop/issues/50/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/noctuid/tdrop/issues/50/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/noctuid/tdrop/issues/50/events","html_url":"https://github.com/noctuid/tdrop/pull/50","id":380456346,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjMwNjUwMzEz","number":50,"title":"Fixes
