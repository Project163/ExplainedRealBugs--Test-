support for font ligatures using harfbuzz and free type on linux.\r\nThis builds on the work done by @anirudhb in [[WIP] Basic text shaping and rendering using Harfbuzz](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/pull/2181)\r\nStep in the direction towards closing #50 .\r\n\r\nThis is relatively early in it's implementation but I wanted to get some eyes on it as changes past this point will start to effect core pieces of infrastructure (rendering etc.).\r\n\r\nCurrently code will render ligatures on linux with a monospace font (I've only tested with Fira Code).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4822730/61919571-0f6fd880-af0b-11e9-9104-2d7567aaa335.png)\r\n\r\n## Major Changes \r\n---\r\n* TextRun replaces RenderableCell as main method of rendering text\r\n* Harfbuzz used to shape runs of text (allowing ligatures)\r\n* GlyphKey uses u32 (glyph index) instead of char\r\n\r\nSupport for font ligatures is enabled by changing the base rendering unit from a RenderableCell to a TextRun (name flexible). A TextRun bundles a series of RenderableCells that share the same render properties (line, fg, bg, etc.) into one unit. Each TextRun gets shaped by harfbuzz returning the glyph indices for each character.  From here each glyph is rasterized as normal through the glyph cache.\r\n\r\nChanges are guarded behind the `hb-ft` feature in `alacritty_terminal`. \r\nAlong with adding new code under this feature, some code is removed when this feature is turned on. Mainly code dealing with rendering RenderableCell's (and GlyphKey's c member).\r\nThe idea behind this is to ensure that there aren't any unknown uses of RenderableCell in the codebase. Once the code is free of RenderableCell when hb-ft is on, more intrusive changes can be made to rendering that break the conventions set by RenderableCell.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n---\r\n* Only works on linux.\r\n* Incurs performance hit of shape() call for each text run for each draw call (haven't done any testing yet to see how steep this is).\r\n* Ignores position information from harfbuzz, this means it probably only works for monospace ligatures (Fira Code) since each ligature is still rendered as if it's in it's own cell.\r\n* Each Face object carries an instance of hb_font with it, in addition to `freetype::Face`, this doesn't seem hugely problematic but is should definitely be noted.\r\n* Post shaping work is mainly done in Glyph Indices, this makes it hard to employ the same font recovery technique currently used by `load_face_with_glyph` as we don't have a char available to guess at the font. This functionality can be recovered by keeping the char stored with it's indice however this means `GlyphKey` would no longer fit in a `u64`.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n---\r\n* Should TextRuns be cached similar to how GlyphKeys are currently?\r\n* Can this approach be adapted to Mac OSX and Windows, and if it can how different does the code need to be?\r\n* Currently code grabs a `Vec<RenderableCell>` from `grid` and wraps that as a `TextRunIter` to produce `TextRun`s. Would it make more sense for `grid` to directly produce a `TextRunIter` and avoid the unecessary middle allocation (hopefully)?\r\n* Should alacritty only support monospace ligatures and ignore \"proper\" ligatures?\r\n* Can `TextRun` completely replace `RenderabelCell`?\r\n* Does it make sense to use glyph index in `GlyphKey` (instead of char)?\r\n\r\n## Remaining Work\r\n---\r\n* Rendering and Atlas construction should hopefully be able to take more advantage of TextRuns then they are currently (none).\r\n* Font ligatures should be a configurable option, this is a matter of enabling/disabling the harfbuzz feature based on a bool.\r\n* Harfbuzz supports building a font from a freetype Face directly, however none of the rust bindings expose that functionality currently.\r\n* Glyph Index is represented by a raw u32, this should be replaced with a newtype wrapper such as `GlyphIndex(u32)` similar to Line and Column.\r\n* Benchmarking performance with new TextRun implementation\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to the open source community so my apologies if something is out of place or I've missed a process I should've completed.\r\n\r\nI initially ran my code through `cargo fmt` however it changed a ton of the codebase that I hadn't touched so I undid those changes. Is there a common `rustfmt.toml` config the repo uses?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2677/reactions","total_count":140,"+1":45,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":94,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/515749109","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2680#issuecomment-515749109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2680","id":515749109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTc0OTEwOQ==","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-28T09:53:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T10:05:50Z","body":"@chrisduerr I guess, I've found a starting point and it seems like something is super weird here.
