Fixes https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2191\r\n* Fixes downstream https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5876\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n- [x] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- (n/a) Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n- (n/a) Created or updated an example program if it would help users understand this functionality\r\n- (n/a) Updated [feature matrix](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/FEATURES.md), if new features were added or implemented\r\n\r\nFor testing:\r\n* First make sure \"Prefer tabs\" is set to \"always\" in macOS system preferences\r\n    * (so new windows will get grouped as tabs).\r\n*
