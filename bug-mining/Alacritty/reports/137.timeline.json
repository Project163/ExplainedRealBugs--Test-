handling on Wayland is done by the following way. Mesa sends `wl_surface.frame` requests to the Wayland server, asking it to fire a frame event in response when an appropriate time for drawing has come.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the Wayland server sends such events to clients that requested them in synchronization with VSync, so all goes well.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\nSome Wayland servers such as Sway do an optimization that consists of not sending frame events to clients when their windows are not visible at all (because they are minimized, on an other workspace, or completely hidden by an other window), under the rationale that there is no point drawing content that will never be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears when an app relies on EGL's VSync handling, in which case if the window is hidden `eglSwapBuffer` will block until a frame event is received, that is until the window becomes visible again. This has the consequence of completely freezing said app as soon as it is not visible any more. This causes https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/2851 for example.\r\n\r\n**Theoretically proper solution:**\r\n\r\nThe Good Way™ to do handle this is that apps should *not* use mesa's vsync on Wayland, but rather request and track frame events themselves. This way they only draw at the appropriate times, but still continue processing events even if they are hidden. This is what GTK and Qt do for example.\r\n\r\nA way to translate this into winit/glutin would be to add a method on winit's `Window` to request a frame event, and translate them into `RedrawRequested` events. Meaning that winit-based app would have to always disable vsync and use this special API on Wayland.\r\n\r\nThis would be the most flexible solution, but it would impose special codepath to winit users for Wayland, which goes completely against the idea of abstracting away the platform.\r\n\r\n**Pramatic proposition:**\r\n\r\nThis is why I suggest we instead integrate in glutin what I'd call \"manual vsync with timeout\". When VSync is requested on Wayland, glutin would *not* activate it in the underlying EGL, but rather manage it manually (with the frame request/events) with the special addition that it'd block with timeout rather than indefinitely when waiting for a frame event. For example with a timeout of 1 second.\r\n\r\nThis would be a relatively small and simple code addition to glutin, and would have the consequence that Wayland apps that are not visible would see their vsync drop to 1fps, rather than completely freeze.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/glutin/issues/1231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/glutin/issues/1231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/543929114","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2851#issuecomment-543929114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2851","id":543929114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzkyOTExNA==","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T20:30:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T20:30:18Z","body":"Upstream
