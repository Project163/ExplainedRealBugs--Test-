was looking further at #3198\r\n\r\n`std::fs::canonicalize()` is the call responsible for creating the UNC paths. But I think we don't actually need to canonicalize paths for either of the the ConPTY or WinPTY backends. For example, I tested both with relative paths and they work fine.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest that rather than making some dance with `canonicalize()` followed by working out how to remove the UNC prefix ourselves, we just faithfully pass the user's input `working_directory` on to the PTY. In that case if there's a problem, that's entirely at the hands of the user's config or command line options.\r\n\r\nRelated but not necessary for this PR: I also thought it would be wise to check that the `working_directory` in the user's config file is an absolute path. (Relative paths in the config don't seem to be meaningful to me.)\r\n\r\nI haven't yet updated the changelog; will write an appropriate message if you agree that this is the right solution for #3198
