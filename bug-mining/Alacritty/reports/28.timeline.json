Function keys are probably what you would expect\r\n# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as\r\n# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,\r\n# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.\r\n#\r\n# Possible values for `mods`\r\n# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key\r\n# `Control` for the control key\r\n# `Shift` for the Shift key\r\n# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option\r\n#\r\n# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift\r\n# looks like:\r\n#\r\n# mods: Control|Shift\r\n#\r\n# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -\r\n# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace\r\n# around them.\r\n#\r\n# Either an `action` or `chars` field must be present. `chars` writes the\r\n# specified string every time that binding is activated. These should generally\r\n# be escape sequences, but they can be configured to send arbitrary strings of\r\n# bytes. Possible values of `action` include `Paste` and `PasteSelection`.\r\n#\r\n# Want to add a binding (e.g. \"PageUp\") but are unsure what the X sequence\r\n# (e.g. \"\\x1b[5~\") is?
