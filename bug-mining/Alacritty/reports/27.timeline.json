I'd say `urxvt` has some edge-cases where things are weird and it does not handle the `Hidden` attribute at all (neither does `Alacritty` at the moment). In contrast `XTerm` is very consistent and supports the `Hidden` attribute.\r\n\r\nIn `XTerm` no matter which circumstances are present, the foreground color and background color are always inversed upon selection, even if the cell is `Hidden`, the foreground color which would be present is still used for the inverse. Rendering text with the same foreground and background color on top of each other also doesn't exhibit any special behavior, it is rendered as \"invisible\" (see Screenshot in previous comment) and when inversed with selection, the cells simply do not change at all (it inverses from red on red to red on red).\r\n\r\nI think this makes the most sense, it should be easy to implement and come without any surprises for the user.

adds support for the `hidden` escape sequence `\\e[8m`, which will\r\nrender the text as invisible.\r\n\r\nThis has also raised a few questions about the rendering of foreground\r\nand background colors and their interaction with the different escape\r\nsequences. Previously, Alacritty has oriented itself after URxvt, which\r\nhas some strange and unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation of color inversion is modeled after XTerm, which\r\nhas a consistent pattern of always inverting the foreground and\r\nbackground colors. This should hopefully lead to less confusion for the\r\nuser and a more consistent behavior.\r\n\r\nA full matrix showcasing the new way Alacritty inverses text can be\r\nfound here:\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/d1XavG7.png\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1454 and fixes #1455.\r\n\r\n@jwilm you've mentioned that things were implemented this way for a reason,\r\nmodeling Alacritty after URxvt and allowing transparency to work properly.\r\nI'd be interested to hear what you think about the changes to color inversion,\r\nI'd say this is a pretty clear improvement because it makes things a lot more\r\nconsistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1460/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dnkl","id":14031526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14031526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl","html_url":"https://github.com/dnkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T19:06:11Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T19:06:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485","id":346291738,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDYyOTE3Mzg=","number":1485,"title":"bring

implements 24-bit colors through a semicolon-separated escape sequence (38;2;...). However, the preferred escape sequence is now colon-separated, with an optional color space argument prefixing the rgb arguments.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps best described in the comment for the parse_extended_colors() function in xterm-333/charproc.c:\r\n\r\nNote that xterm actually supports *three* variants: semicolor-separated, colon-separated, and a mixed version. It's unclear to me why it supports the third variant.\r\n\r\n> Some background -\r\n> \r\n> Todd Larason provided the initial changes to support 256-colors in July 1999.\r\n> I pointed out that the description of SGR 38/48 in ECMA-48 was vague, and\r\n> was unsure if there would be some standard using those codes.  His response\r\n> was that this was documented (it turns out, in equally vague terms) in ITU\r\n> T.416\r\n> \r\n> Discussing this with Todd Larason in mid-1999, my point was that given the\r\n> high cost of obtaining ITU T.416 (ISO-8613-6), the standard was not going\r\n> to be effective (more than $100 then, more than $200 in 2012)\r\n> \r\n> We overlooked the detail about \":\" as a subparameter delimiter (documented\r\n> in 5.4.t2 in ECMA-48).  Some discussion in KDE in mid-2006 led Lars Doelle\r\n> to discuss the issue with me.  Lars' initial concern dealt with the fact\r\n> that a sequence such as\r\n>  CSI 38 ; 5 ; 1 m\r\n> violated the principle that SGR parameters could be used in any order.\r\n> Further discussion (see KDE #107487) resolved that the standard expected\r\n> that the sequence would look like\r\n>  CSI 38 ; 5 : 1 m\r\n> which still violates that principle, since the \"5:1\" parameter has to\r\n> follow the \"38\" to be useful.\r\n> \r\n> This function accepts either format (per request by Paul Leonerd Evans).\r\n> It also accepts\r\n>  CSI 38 : 5 : 1 m\r\n> according to Lars' original assumption.  While implementing that, I added\r\n> support for Konsole's interpretation of \"CSI 38 : 2\" as a 24-bit RGB value.\r\n> ISO-8613-6 documents that as \"direct color\".\r\n> \r\n> At the time in 2012, no one noticed (or commented) regarding ISO-8613-6's\r\n> quirk in the description of direct color:  it mentions a color space\r\n> identifier parameter which should follow the \"2\" (as parameter 1).  In the\r\n> same section, ISO-8613-6 mentions a parameter 6 which can be ignored, as\r\n> well as parameters 7 and 8.  Like parameter 1, parameters 7 and 8 are not\r\n> defined clearly in the standard, and a close reading indicates they are\r\n> optional, saying they \"may be used\".  This implementation ignores parameters\r\n> 6 (and above), and provides for the color space identifier by checking the\r\n> number of parameters:\r\n>  3 after \"2\" (no color space identifier)\r\n>  4 or more after \"2\" (color space identifier)\r\n> \r\n> By the way - all of the parameters are decimal integers, and missing\r\n> parameters represent a default value.  ISO-8613-6 is clear about that.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as of ncurses 6.1, the correct way to tell applications that the terminal supports 24-bit colors is by setting the terminfo setaf/setab capabilities. The Tc option is, as far as I can tell, obsolete. It is not used at all in any terminfo entries in ncurses 6.1.\r\n\r\nThe terminfo database provided with ncurses 6.1 defines a couple of \"features\" related to this: *xterm+direct*, *xterm+direct2* and *xterm+indirect*.\r\n\r\n*indirect* corresponds to the escape sequence implemented by alacritty today, i.e. semicolon-separated.\r\n\r\n*direct2* corresponds to the colon-separated version *without* the color space argument, and *direct* corresponds to the colon-separated version *with* the (optional) color space argument.\r\n\r\nOne can \"use\" these features to get the correct setaf/setab capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe alacritty.info file could/should be updated to use one of these definitions. As a first step, use the indirect version, and switch to the direct one if/when the colon-separated escape sequence is implemented.\r\n\r\nFYI, I find the current alacritty.info to be a bit weird, in that it uses xterm-256color in the alacritty definition. If I set TERM to a non-256color entry, it's because _I don't want_ 256 colors...\r\n\r\nI've been using the following replacement for some time now, with success. 24-bit support works in both vim and emacs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nalacritty| alacritty,\r\n\tuse=xterm,\r\n\r\nalacritty-256color| alacritty with 256 colors,\r\n\tuse=xterm+256color, use=alacritty,\r\n\r\nalacritty-direct| alacritty with direct-color indexing,\r\n\tuse=xterm+indirect, use=alacritty,\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1853446167,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NTM0NDYxNjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1853446167","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0674d0cc2b061ea4eb6b4f5ce3f036f7f117a8de","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/0674d0cc2b061ea4eb6b4f5ce3f036f7f117a8de","created_at":"2018-09-18T20:40:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1855929623,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg1NTkyOTYyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1855929623","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-19T19:18:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1855929849,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NTU5Mjk4NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1855929849","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d387ebe1d7fe9f9fe9d840039aba68efffe5a233","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/d387ebe1d7fe9f9fe9d840039aba68efffe5a233","created_at":"2018-09-19T19:18:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
