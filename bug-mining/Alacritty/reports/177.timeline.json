Testing the transparency feature out on Windows (both via `examples/transparency.rs` and with a build of alacritty), I was unable to reproduce the issue described in the old comment in this code. I suppose it's possible that this only manifests on some configurations though (for completeness, I'm testing on a Windows 10 environment, though I cross-compiled things on a Linux box using GNU tools). To be on the safe side, it might make sense for other people with access to a Windows environment to double check that this doesn't regress anything.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I removed a couple of redundant bits in the Windows API calls (see the description below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Original commit message follows:*\r\n\r\nThis patch removes an unneeded workaround for transparent windows on the Windows platform. In addition, it simplifies a couple of related API calls:\r\n\r\n* Remove the `CreateRectRgn` call, since we want the entire window's region to have blur behind it, and `DwnEnableBlurBehindWindow` does that by default.\r\n* Remove the `color_key` for `SetLayeredWindowAttributes`, since it's not used (we're not passing `winuser::LWA_COLORKEY` to the flags).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/656358549","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1927#issuecomment-656358549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1927","id":656358549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjM1ODU0OQ==","user":{"login":"jimporter","id":826865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjg2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/826865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter","html_url":"https://github.com/jimporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimporter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-09T21:24:15Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T21:24:15Z","body":"For those who are interested, I filed a PR to fix this in winit: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1621.

its original purpose, commit 6343059b \"Fix Windows transparency\r\nbehavior to support fully-opaque regions (#1621)\" also included some\r\nchanges considered cleanups, one of them was:\r\n\r\n* Remove the `CreateRectRgn` call, since we want the entire window's region to\r\n  have blur behind it, and `DwnEnableBlurBehindWindow` does that by default.\r\n\r\nBut the original code actually disabled the blur effect for the whole\r\nwindow by creating an empty region for it, because that allows for the\r\nwindow to be truely fully transparent. With the blur effect in place,\r\nthe areas meant to be transparent either blur the things behind it\r\n(until Windows 8) or are darkened (since Windows 8). This also means\r\nthat on Windows 8 and newer, the resulting colors are darker than\r\nintended in translucent areas when the blur effect is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis restores the behaviour from winit <0.24 and fixes #1814.\r\n\r\nArguably, one might want to expose the ability to control the blur\r\nregion, but that is outside the scope of this commit.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n- [x] Compilation warnings were addressed\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt` has been run on this branch\r\n- [x] `cargo doc` builds successfully\r\n- [ ] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n- [ ] Created or updated an example program if it would help users understand this functionality\r\n- [ ] Updated [feature matrix](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/FEATURES.md), if new features were added or implemented\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1815/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
