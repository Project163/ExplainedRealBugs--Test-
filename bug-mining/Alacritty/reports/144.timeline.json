I didn't have the `size` property set before, but to get a better font that I could read normally as before the update, I had to set it to at least `12` to get a decent font definition.\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks set to `12` in the retina screen:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 3 32 22 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1834718/84125222-db59b500-aa01-11ea-95da-76bea86fd716.png)\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks set to `12` in the ultrawide external screen:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 3 41 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1834718/84126226-4061da80-aa03-11ea-900c-45fb158796a6.png)\r\n\r\nTried removing `use_thin_strokes` to see if that makes any change but nothing, only changing the size to higher numbers makes the font readable again.\r\n\r\nI don't have any problem setting `size` to `12`, but it was not needed before the last update, I'm curious what changed or what I need to do differently now.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: macOS Catalina 10.15.5 \r\nVersion: 0.4.3 (c723247)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n**Font/Terminal size:**\r\nWithout external monitor screen, opened in the retina screen of the macbook pro.\r\n```\r\nalacritty -vv                                                                                \r\nCreated log file at \"/var/folders/hb/zdwfb9h161l1zx47s8k0y1w00000gn/T/Alacritty-5046.log\"\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.571141000] [DEBUG] Using environment locale: en_US.UTF-8\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.571339000] [INFO] Welcome to Alacritty\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.571367000] [INFO] Configuration loaded from \"/Users/gioyik/.alacritty.yml\"\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.612633000] [DEBUG] Estimated DPR: 2\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.612709000] [DEBUG] Estimated Cell Size: 13 x 26\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:52.612735000] [DEBUG] Estimated Dimensions: None\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.602634000] [INFO] Device pixel ratio: 2\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.607986000] [INFO] Initializing glyph cache...\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.652406000] [INFO] ... finished initializing glyph cache in 0.044293613s\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.652504000] [INFO] Cell Size: 13 x 26\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.652535000] [INFO] Padding: 0 x 0\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.652561000] [INFO] Width: 1600, Height: 1200\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.652640000] [INFO] PTY Dimensions: Line(46) x Column(123)\r\n[2020-06-09 03:04:53.658151000] [INFO] Initialisation complete\r\n[2020-06-09 03:05:02.442563000] [INFO] Goodbye\r\nDeleted log file at \"/var/folders/hb/zdwfb9h161l1zx47s8k0y1w00000gn/T/Alacritty-5046.log\"\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 3 09 53 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1834718/84122891-b9126800-a9fe-11ea-9882-bf74949b6aaf.png\">\r\n\r\nOpened in an external ultrawide monitor screen, not the retina screen of the macbook pro.\r\n\r\n```\r\nalacritty -vv                                                                                \r\nCreated log file at \"/var/folders/hb/zdwfb9h161l1zx47s8k0y1w00000gn/T/Alacritty-14061.log\"\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.742990000] [DEBUG] Using environment locale: en_US.UTF-8\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.746124000] [INFO] Welcome to Alacritty\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.746159000] [INFO] Configuration loaded from \"/Users/gioyik/.alacritty.yml\"\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.783261000] [DEBUG] Estimated DPR: 1\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.783339000] [DEBUG] Estimated Cell Size: 6 x 13\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.783368000] [DEBUG] Estimated Dimensions: None\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.831313000] [INFO] Device pixel ratio: 1\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.834795000] [INFO] Initializing glyph cache...\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.865708000] [INFO] ... finished initializing glyph cache in 0.030789706s\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.865779000] [INFO] Cell Size: 6 x 13\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.865804000] [INFO] Padding: 0 x 0\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.865827000] [INFO] Width: 800, Height: 600\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.865897000] [INFO] PTY Dimensions: Line(46) x Column(133)\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:01.869283000] [INFO] Initialisation complete\r\n[2020-06-09 03:34:15.197727000] [INFO] Goodbye\r\nDeleted log file at \"/var/folders/hb/zdwfb9h161l1zx47s8k0y1w00000gn/T/Alacritty-14061.log\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(here `size` is not set to any value)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 3 34 36 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1834718/84125449-2d9ad600-aa02-11ea-98da-f8e0aaa993df.png)\r\n\r\n### Configuration file\r\n\r\n```\r\nlive_config_reload: true\r\n\r\ndimensions:\r\n  x: 80\r\n  y: 80\r\n\r\nposition:\r\n  x: 10\r\n  y: 10\r\n\r\ncursor:\r\n  style: Block\r\n\r\nscrolling:\r\n  history: 0\r\n\r\n# Colors (Dracula)\r\ncolors:\r\n  #
