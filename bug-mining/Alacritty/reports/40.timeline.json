tried this on a slower machine and there I'm able to reproduce this issue. I'm not quite sure what's going on here but it seems like a bug. It's potentially possible that this is caused by winit but I'd say it's unlikely, once the mouse down event is received alacritty should know the start position, so it's likely that there's some kind of problem in alacritty.\r\n\r\nNow the only question left is if this is also present on the scrollback branch. I'll try to test this whenever I've got the time, but if you want to test this on your machine too @jrouleau it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Note that I'd personally say that the original issue mentioned here is probably a wontfix. I can imagine that a configuration option could be introduced if someone is willing to do the work, but it's unlikely the default behavior is going to be changed. However the bug should definitely be fixed, so I'd use this issue to track the progress on fixing that bug. If you want to create a separate issue for tracking a configuration option for sub-cell selection start, feel free to do so.

reliably.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/398784348/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/398876919","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1366#issuecomment-398876919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1366","id":398876919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODg3NjkxOQ==","user":{"login":"jrouleau","id":11533746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMzNzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11533746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau","html_url":"https://github.com/jrouleau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrouleau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T19:58:05Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T19:58:05Z","body":"@chrisduerr
