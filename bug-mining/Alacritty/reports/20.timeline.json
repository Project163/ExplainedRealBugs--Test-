non-bracketed pasting *is* the issue here.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"enter\" key is hit, a `CR` (`^M`) is generated (see http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html).\r\n\r\nIn non-bracketed mode, `LF`s (`^J`) in pasted data have to be replaced with `CR`s in order to simulate keypresses.\r\n\r\nIn non-bracketed mode, applications have no way of distinguishing if data comes from the keyboard or the clipboard, so it seems sensible that a terminal must simulate keypresses.\r\n\r\nTo me it is not 100% clear to what extent a terminal is supposed to do that (ie: whether octets corresponding to other control characters or maybe to bytes with the high bit set should be processed). Maybe data bytes should be interleaved with `^V`s?
