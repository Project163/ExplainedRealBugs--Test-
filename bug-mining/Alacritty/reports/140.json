I'm not sure if this is a bug, or working as intended.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce on latest master:\r\n\r\n* Open a small window, and generate a screen-full of data (e.g. `ls -al /usr/bin`).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1403503/77237296-58148a00-6b9d-11ea-8490-cc74feb52641.png)\r\n\r\n* Open something like `vim`, then resize the terminal to be a bit bigger.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1403503/77237301-69f62d00-6b9d-11ea-8a74-57f8d6ca1665.png)\r\n\r\n* Quit `vim`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1403503/77237305-75e1ef00-6b9d-11ea-99f0-7725aedf87b8.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point, there is now a bunch of garbage output from the original command _below_ the current prompt, and a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> is necessary to make the terminal usable again.
