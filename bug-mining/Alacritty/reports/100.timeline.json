Linux X11, Xfwm4, Alacritty 0.4.0\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nwhen disconnecting all monitors from my laptop and then closing the lid, there is a high probability that all Alacritty windows crash. Curiously, this doesn't seem to happen when I unplug the last monitor *after* closing the lid. Relevant log:\r\n\r\n```thread 'main' panicked at 'Failed to update normal hints: XError { description: \"BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\", error_code: 2, request_code: 12, minor_code: 0 }', src/libcore/result.rs:999:5```\r\n\r\nThis seems very similar to #1789, but that one was supposedly fixed by EventLoop 2.0, which is present in Alacritty 0.4.0 (isn't it?). I also suspect that #2516 might be the same bug, but I cannot be sure.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3129150430,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxMjkxNTA0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3129150430","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"07df4e12ec402c352f222a7f5bdb337337c6ed48","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roychoo/alacritty/commits/07df4e12ec402c352f222a7f5bdb337337c6ed48","created_at":"2020-03-14T09:05:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3129156562,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxMjkxNTY1NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3129156562","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3ab1d5f8aaf8da838769924641f7d4aa88504ee8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roychoo/alacritty/commits/3ab1d5f8aaf8da838769924641f7d4aa88504ee8","created_at":"2020-03-14T09:14:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3249249057,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNDkyNDkwNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3249249057","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9e46acc87720dec1c592599e30ef70a69b3b5acd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roychoo/alacritty/commits/9e46acc87720dec1c592599e30ef70a69b3b5acd","created_at":"2020-04-19T16:47:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3249249304,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNDkyNDkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3249249304","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_u
