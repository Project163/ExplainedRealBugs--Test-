proximate cause is the absence of the `wl_data_source.cancelled()`, with the effect that the old `wl_data_source` -- still entirely valid so far as the protocol is concerned -- is being used, no matter how many new ones are successfuly created and offered to the compositor. Once another client sets the selection the cycle is broken as `cancelled()` is finally received. \r\n\r\nIf the `WAYLAND_DEBUG` logs under GNOME show the same thing it would be unlikely to be a compositor bug, but even if it isn't I would strongly suspect that it's not really alacritty proper that is at fault but one in the chain of dependencies that are actually speaking Wayland to the compositor.
