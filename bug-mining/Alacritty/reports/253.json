It is supposed to maximize the window and cover the whole screen. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n* It only happens on my second monitor (3840 x 2160). It is not reproducible when I maximize a window in the built-in monitor. \r\n* In my macOS setup, I auto hide the dock and notification bar.\r\n\r\nI found this commit f409f743724207e7a2a4c008ce74ea505ae6bbcf introduces the problem using git bisect.\r\n\r\nThis is the screenshot with the `decorations` set to `transparent`\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 22 10 36\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12372003/218292651-c6293581-5939-4f84-8218-fb5354a3437a.png\">\r\n`decorations: buttonless`\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 22 11 03\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12372003/218292653-7070ca4f-a31a-49df-b654-fbb5e0cf837e.png\">\r\n`decorations: full`\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 22 11 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12372003/218292655-faf678cc-b98d-4086-9d0e-6124fd9704b2.png\">\r\n\r\nPay attention to the small gaps around the window.\r\n\r\nThis is the screenshot using 8a838710 with `decorations: buttonless`\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 22 19 51\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12372003/218292825-f7951972-7e0b-4a9d-b4f6-2ef30a36d86b.png\">\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6696/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
