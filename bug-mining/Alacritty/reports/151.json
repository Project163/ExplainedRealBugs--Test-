In vim, regardless of direction the `gN` action always jumps to the next match start to the left of the cursor, while the `gn` action always jumps to the next search end to the right of the cursor.\r\n\r\nWhile both approaches might seem reasonable at first, vim's approach has a significant advantage wrt predictability and automation of the movement. By always knowing which direction the motion goes to, this allows for mappings that predictably navigate inside the current match regardless of the global search direction. So deleting until the end of the match would always be `dgn` for example, regardless in which direction the user has jumped to it.\r\n\r\nSo to improve the ability to compose this binding and make it easier to use for vim users, we should emulate vim's behavior rather than sticking closer to the SearchNext and SearchPrevious bindings.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
