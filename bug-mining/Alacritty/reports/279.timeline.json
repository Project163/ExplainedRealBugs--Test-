character before inserting the character itself). i have a .Xmodmap which swaps the shifted state of the number row (so for instance `keycode 10 = exclam 1`), though, and with it, alt+shift+1 still sends `\\e1` but alt+1 sends just `!`. alt+2 does send `\\e@` though, and it looks like this is because the glutin library contains a keycode for `At`, while it doesn't for any of the other shifted num-row characters - the key event that is being processed contains `Some(At)` in this case, while it contains `None` as the `VirtualKeyCode` for the other cases. i'm not sure if this is a thing that would need to be fixed in glutin or if it can be worked around in alacritty directly, but it'd be nice if it could be made to work (all of the other terminals i've tried have handled it correctly).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1574621156,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NzQ2MjExNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1574621156","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ddcf44d9271192d82e916c88948b130b55d1422e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/ddcf44d9271192d82e916c88948b130b55d1422e","created_at":"2018-04-14T16:50:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2761247747,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NjEyNDc3NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2761247747","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T20:05:38Z","label":{"name":"A

main highlight of this update is that alacritty will now use new\r\nkeyboard API from the winit, which resolves a lot of issues around\r\nkey bindings, such as ability to bind dead keys. It also fixes long\r\nstanding issues with the virtual key code bindings and make bindings in\r\ngeneral more predictable. It also makes our default Vi key bindings\r\nfully working.\r\n\r\nGiven that alacritty was using `VirtualKey` directly in the bindings\r\nfrom the winit, and winit simply removed the enum, we've added internal\r\nconversions to minimize the fallout, but new way to specify the bindings\r\nshould be more intuitive.\r\n\r\nOther part of this update fixes some forward compatibility bugs with the\r\nWayland backend, given that wayland-rs 0.30 is fully forward compatible.\r\nThe update also fixes weird Maximized startup issues on GNOME Wayland,\r\nhowever they were present on any sane compositor.\r\n\r\nFixes #6842.\r\nFixes #6455.\r\nFixes #6184.\r\nFixes #5684.\r\nFixes #3574.\r\nFixes #3460.\r\nFixes #1336.\r\nFixes #892.\r\nFixes #458.\r\nFixes #55.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6958/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
