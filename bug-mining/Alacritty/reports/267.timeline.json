use Alacritty on Wayland, specifically with the Sway window manager. Alacritty uses this underlying library to handle text copying and pasting. When pasting text from the clipboard with Alacritty (using default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> key binding) the pasted text will actually be older, previously copied text. Pasting again will eventually paste the most recently copied text, however it may take several repetitions before it \"bubbles\" up.\r\n\r\nThis only seems to occur on a very long running Alacritty instance. For example, I have several Alacritty instances open, and the recently started processes do not exhibit this issue, but a very old instance does exhibit this behavior and continues to do so.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Start Alacritty and use the same instance over the course of many days.\r\n2. Copy text to clipboard using any means (other applications that have access to Wayland clipboard or Alacritty itself)\r\n3. Paste text using Alacritty. The pasted text will incorrectly be previously copied text. Subsequent pastes will eventually paste the most recently copied text.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n* Copy \"foo\" from text using some application.\r\n* In Alacritty at a shell, execute a Paste hot key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> by default)\r\n* \"foo\" should be output to the screen. If it isn't, it may be \"queued up\". Keep retrying the Paste operation until \"foo\" is outputted.\r\n* Copy \"bar\" from text using some application.\r\n* Repeat Paste hot key an arbitrary amount of times. Alacritty will output \"foo\" each time until eventually \"bar\" is output\r\n\r\nNote: In the above, \"some application\" can be anything that is able to copy text to the Wayland clipboard. The above example occurs for both copying using Alacritty's highlighting and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, or copying text in Firefox.\r\n\r\nHere is a Youtube video I created which demonstrates the issue:\r\n[![Youtube

handling is essential for system window handling and also is a\r\ncomplicated task to be implemented and handled properly. So abstracting\r\nthis code into a windowing library like `winit` is the most sensible\r\nthing to do.\r\n\r\nWhile it could be offloaded to crates like copypasta[1] the result is\r\nalways not good enough[2][3] and it also results in\r\noverengineering[4] (look at its codebase size and compare to what we've\r\ngot in winit for Wayland and how much better the handling is done in\r\nwinit).\r\n\r\nThe new API is on the `Window` and is the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn set_clipboard_content<C: AsRef<[u8]> + 'static>(\r\n    &self,\r\n    content:\r\n    C, mimes: HashSet<String>);\r\n\r\npub fn request_clipboard_content(\r\n    &self,\r\n    mimes: HashSet<String>,\r\n    metadata: Option<std::sync::Arc<ClipboardMetadata>>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd also on `WindowExtUnix` where added similar methods to get primary\r\nselection content (The one on middle mouse button).\r\n\r\nWorking with clipboard is async and loading it is in resulted window\r\nevent in `event::WindowEvent::ClipboardContent`.\r\n\r\nThe use of metadata is due to provide ability to identify requested\r\nload from system's clipboard.\r\n\r\n[1] -

This is certainly a bug somewhere in the alacritty application, not an X11/wayland bug.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Run this program\r\n2. As soon as it prints \"paste now\" paste into an alacritty terminal. You have a 7 second grace period since alacritty, internally, uses a 3 second timeout.\r\n4. Wait until it prints \"timeout-done\"\r\n5. Nothing will happen in the alacritty window.\r\n6. That alacritty window is now stuck in this buggy state, permanently.\r\n9. Go copy some other random text and paste it into the alacritty window.\r\n10. Alacritty will show \"some-text\" instead of whatever you just pasted.\r\n\r\nSomeone mentioned it was using sync::mpsc channels, and my best guess is that something is using a channel to send loads from the clipboard, but stops reading it after the timeout. If setting the clipboard succeeds within 3 seconds it's fine, if it fails it's fine, but if it succeeds after 3 seconds then the stale value is being sent on a channel that no one is listening to. The next time a load is requested it starts a load but receives the stale value on that channel.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::thread;\r\nuse std::time::Duration;\r\n\r\nuse gtk4::prelude::{ApplicationExt, ApplicationExtManual, DisplayExt};\r\nuse gtk4::traits::WidgetExt;\r\nuse gtk4::{glib, Application, ApplicationWindow};\r\n\r\nfn main() -> glib::ExitCode {\r\n    let app = Application::builder().application_id(\"org.example.HelloWorld\").build();\r\n\r\n    app.connect_activate(|app| {\r\n\r\n        let window = ApplicationWindow::builder()\r\n            .application(app)\r\n            .default_width(320)\r\n            .default_height(200)\r\n            .title(\"Hello, World!\")\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\n        let clip = window.display().clipboard();\r\n\r\n        clip.set_text(\"some-text\");\r\n        println!(\"paste now\");\r\n        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10));\r\n        println!(\"timeout done\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    app.run()\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso breaks the copypasta demo application posted
