On my Mac, when I hit Ctrl+Shift+-, it prints \"hi\" as expected.  On my linux box (details below), nothing happens.  A `print-events` log is attached.  I basically just launched alacritty, hit Ctrl+Shift+- and then Alt+F4.  It looks like the character that's received is `\\u{1f}` for some reason.\r\n\r\nBased on the log output, I then tried changing the config to use the word `Subtract` instead of `Minus` but still nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI feel like this is just something I'm doing wrong, not a bug or anything, but I have no idea what it is.  \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux - Ubuntu 19.10\r\nVersion: `alacritty --version` output\r\n  `alacritty 0.4.2-rc1`\r\nLinux/BSD: X11/Wayland (default Gnome installation that comes with ubuntu)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nCrashes: STDERR, STDOUT\r\nFont/Terminal size: `alacritty -vv`\r\nKeyboard and bindings: `alacritty --print-events`\r\n[output.txt](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/4333216/output.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3460/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3460/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
