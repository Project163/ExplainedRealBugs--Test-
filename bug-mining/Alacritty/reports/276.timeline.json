suspected that using Shift might invalidate the `L/RBracket` key designation, as Shift normally would *curly* brackets instead of square ones, but as I understand, `L/RBracket` catches both curly and square brackets, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n*P.S. for the curious: as the comment suggests, I'm using the keymapping to send `\"leader\"+]` in vim, which in turn triggers `:bn` (next buffer) mapping
