This bug turns out to be an interesting problem! To see why we get the flickering and why it's difficult to resolve, consider how the read/parse/draw loop works:\r\n\r\n1. Some data arrives from the pty. The I/O thread reads this into a buffer.\r\n2. I/O thread locks the terminal state struct and runs that buffer through the parser.\r\n3. I/O thread registers that terminal is dirty and requests a draw.\r\n4. I/O thread releases lock on terminal state, blocks for another read.\r\n5. The render thread acquires lock, draws frame, and calls swap buffers.\r\n\r\nThe call at the end to swap buffers will block for ~17ms, and another frame cannot be drawn until it returns. The flickering happens because:\r\n\r\n1. Just enough data is read to cause the terminal to scroll\r\n2. frame is drawn\r\n3. more data arrives to fill in scrolled area, but it cannot be drawn until next frame\r\n\r\nTo me, this seems like a problem with terminal protocol. There's no framing, so we cannot know whether more data is coming or not.\r\n\r\nSince we can't fix terminal protocol, we're left with doing something heuristical like trying to read with a short timeout. The trick with such a heuristic is providing sufficient time for related data to arrive without ever causing a frame skip.\r\n\r\nIf you or anyone else has other ideas on how to address this, or even ideas about how such a heuristic could work, I'm all ears. I've been thinking about this problem for a while and haven't come up with a solution I love.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/305555878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/305585077","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598#issuecomment-305585077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598","id":305585077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTU4NTA3Nw==","user":{"login":"asilvadesigns","id":7071307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzEzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7071307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns","html_url":"https://github.com/asilvadesigns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asilvadesigns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T18:49:02Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T18:51:49Z","body":"@fuine I'm using this plugin, and not experienced the flicker with it, might want to check it out: https://github.com/yuttie/comfortable-motion.vim.

is also ongoing work in neovim to improve the terminal gui. For example:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6816\r\n\r\nWhen using alacritty in neovim I notice a lot more cursor flickering than with other terminals. However, I think this is a problem with vim/neovim because there as been quite a few pull requests that tries to clean up the terminal ui code so that the cursor doesn't jump around so much when drawing updates. (Like this one: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6366)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, @jwilm could there perhaps be a debug mode in alacritty where you can step though the screen updates? That is, you can freeze the screen and then step through the cell updates. I think it would be really helpful when debugging flickering issues in neovim (so you can see what neovim does when it redraws the cursor position for example).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/305590623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DarkDefender","id":312503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjUwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender","html_url":"https://github.com/DarkDefender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1106643979,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTEwNjY0Mzk3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1106643979","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-01T19:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1106643981,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExMDY2NDM5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1106643981","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-01T19:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/305961703","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598#issuecomment-305961703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598","id":305961703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTk2MTcwMw==","user":{"login":"jdebp","id":24855211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp","html_url":"https://github.com/jdebp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-03T08:49:47Z","updated_at":"2017-06-03T08:49:47Z","body":"If your program operates as described, which I am taking on trust and have not looked at your program to check, then _this does_ have its roots in your program.\r\n\r\nPrograms like vim and nvim collect screen output into in-memory buffers and flush it at certain points.  (This is their own buffering system.  Of course, full-screen programs that use standard I/O buffering instead, still do the same thing.)  This results (as one can see from tools like `truss`, `dtrace`, and `strace`) in all output for things like scrolling operations or full screen redraws being sent often in one giant `write()` system call, often several KiB in one big lump.\r\n\r\nYour best strategy in receiving this is to attempt to read and process all of that lump in one go before letting your renderer lock the terminal state for a vertical blanking interval.  It is a falsehood to say that there's no way of doing this.  There are three different approaches, each with their own tradeoffs:\r\n* For programs based upon `kevent()`, the `EVFILT_READ` events contains the number of bytes available to read in the `data` field of the event structure.  It also signals EOF separately from this.\r\n* Making the pseudo-terminal master use non-blocking I/O tells `read()` to return if there are no more data.  This somewhat complicates hangup processing as a side-effect, as `read()` returning zero bytes can mean either temporarily no more data or pseudo-terminal EOF.\r\n* There is a `FIONREAD` generic `ioctl()` available (at least) on the BSDs, on Solaris, and on Linux for terminal devices.\r\n\r\nInstead of simply reading a portion, processing it whilst holding a lock, sending the other thread a shoulder-tap, then going back to look for another portion; make your program repeatedly read and process all portions until the master side of the pseudo-terminal is drained of output sent from the slave side, and only send the shoulder-tap when that is the case.\r\n\r\nOr make your rendering side use a snapshot of the terminal state, and not lock the terminal state for the entire length of time that takes to render.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/305961703/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jdebp","id":24855211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp","html_url":"https://github.com/jdebp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jdebp","id":24855211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp","html_url":"https://github.com/jdebp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T20:39:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T20:39:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/6816","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/6816/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/6816/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/6816/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6816","id":231459382,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTIyNTI1NzU5","number":6816,"title":"TUI

should address:\r\n* #6802 by fixing the bug where nvim believed the terminals that said that they were `xterm`\r\n* #6803 with some doco fixes\r\n* #6795 by refactoring `fix_terminfo()`\r\n* #6778 by making nvim work more like tmux, support `guicursor` on more terminal types, and fall back to DECSCUSR before idiosyncratic control sequences\r\n* #6096 and #5089 by showing in `:help term-dependent-settings` how to deal with `termguicolors`\r\n\r\nThis builds upon #6801 and perhaps looks bigger than it actually is.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the impact of this on #6798 is.  It might also improve #6779.\r\n\r\nBrief précis:\r\n* On systems where there is no terminfo, nvim falls back to its own built-in copies of terminfo.  External terminfo has priority.  External and internal terminfo are _not_ combined, in contrast to what vim does with termcap.  See `:help builtin-terms`.\r\n* nvim tries to set 256-colour mode, even in some cases if the terminal type name does not have a \"-256color\" suffix.  Failing 256-colour mode, it attempts to set at least 16-colour mode.  See `:help 256-color`.\r\n* For true-colour mode, nvim uses the same terminfo extensions that tmux uses.  You can add true colour capability for your terminal simply by enhancing terminfo to describe your terminal type as true colour capable.  See `:help true-color`.\r\n* nvim _avoids_ resizing the terminal display the dtterm way on non-dtterm-compatible terminals, which was a problem for them because the control sequence looks like something else to those terminals.  See `:help xterm-resize`.\r\n* nvim attempts to optimize cursor motions and attribute changes, making use of terminfo capabilities for relative cursor motions and setting groups of attributes all at once.\r\n* nvim uses XTerm's ability to set left and right scrolling margins, for optimized scrolling in split window mode.  This will not be used unless nvim can detect genuine XTerm.\r\n* nvim adjusts the cursor shape on terminals that are known to support it.  This now includes tmux; so no longer does nvim attempt to bypass tmux and instruct tmux's output terminal directly.  Again, you can include your own terminal simply by enhancing your terminfo.

That reads a portion, processes it whilst holding a lock, sends the other thread a shoulder-tap _the first time around_, and then releases the lock and goes back to look for another portion. That's not the same as sending the shoulder tap after the master has been drained; it is not the same as checking that there's no more to read before sending a shoulder tap.\r\n\r\nMoreover, programs like `nvim` _easily_ will cause multiple iterations of that loop with a single screen refresh, or scroll.  A redraw of a mere 80&times;25 window with syntax colouring on, for example, can easily generate between 6KiB and 8KiB of output in 256-colour mode; more in true-colour mode.  (I have managed to cut this down a bit for the `nvim` people, but this is what current release `nvim` does.)\r\n\r\nPrograms such as `nvim` can easily generate far more output in one lump for a single scroll/redraw than you are reading there in each iteration.  And the initial clear screen or scroll command that comes early in the output leaves part of the terminal blank _until_ they re-draw what is on it later in the output.\r\n\r\nSo the problem behaviour is as described.  You are starting the render, locking the terminal state for a vertical blanking interval, when there's more than half of the `nvim` refresh/scroll output yet to be read from the pseudo-terminal and processed and half of the terminal is temporarily blank.  The fix is to process it _all_ before rendering.  Then you won't get tearing like this.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/309276106/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jdebp","id":24855211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp","html_url":"https://github.com/jdebp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdebp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"DarkDefender","id":312503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjUwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender","html_url":"https://github.com/DarkDefender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkDefender/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-25T09:31:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T09:31:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/627","id":237051599,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzcwNTE1OTk=","number":627,"title":"Line

thanks for all the feedback. I'm working on this right now, and I think the way to go is just reading until getting an EWOULDBLOCK. \r\n\r\n> For programs based upon kevent(), the EVFILT_READ ...\r\n\r\nThis sounds great, but there's no equivalent for epoll.\r\n\r\n> There is a FIONREAD generic ioctl() ...\r\n\r\nDoesn't work in my testing on macOS. Upon the event loop signaling read readiness, the ioctl just returns 0.\r\n\r\n> Making the pseudo-terminal master use non-blocking I/O tells read() to return if there are no more data.\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with this approach locally with good results. Note that `nvim` sometimes sends another tiny chunk after the primary chunk when paging. Here's some logs showing bytes processed on each iteration. When WouldBlock is encountered, the renderer is notified and the terminal lock released.\r\n\r\n```\r\n==== enter loop ====\r\ngot 1024\r\ngot 1024\r\ngot 1024\r\ngot 1024\r\ngot 1024\r\ngot
