The value reaches its maximum value (274 in my case) and stays there, pressing <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd> further has no effect. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> once reduces font size to 272.\r\n- Now hold <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd>. The value reaches its minimum value (2 in my case), but further presses of <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> change the value to 2, again and again. If I press <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> 10 times after I already reached the minimal value of 2, then pressing <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd> once will have no effect - the font size will stay at 2. I have to press <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd> 10 times to compensate for my earlier actions, before further presses of <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd> begin to actually increase the font.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
