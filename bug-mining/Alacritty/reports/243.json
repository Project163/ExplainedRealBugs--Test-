Log is below. I cannot reproduce it other than by just using Neovim as I normally would. I also cannot reproduce it with a clean config, though since it happens seemingly at random I might've just not ran into it. But for that reason, I'm linking my config as of the time of this issue [here](https://github.com/Duckonaut/nvim/tree/9afe3c2be60f1990437cac97d61902bc4eeacb4c), plugins list is [here](https://github.com/Duckonaut/nvim/blob/9afe3c2be60f1990437cac97d61902bc4eeacb4c/lua/plugins.lua)\r\n\r\nWhen running under X11, this doesn't ever happen.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.11.0 (8dbaa0bb)\r\nLinux/BSD: Wayland, Hyprland\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nThe important bit:\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', /build/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/calloop-0.10.1/src/loop_logic.rs:101:46\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0:     0x55719bc17431 - <unknown>\r\n   1:     0x55719bad06dc - <unknown>\r\n   2:     0x55719bbedf94 - <unknown>\r\n   3:     0x55719bc193e6 - <unknown>\r\n   4:     0x55719bc1a478 - <unknown>\r\n   5:     0x55719bc19f52 - <unknown>\r\n   6:     0x55719bc19ec6 - <unknown>\r\n   7:     0x55719bc19e82 - <unknown>\r\n   8:     0x55719b8b3ba2 - <unknown>\r\n   9:     0x55719b8b3e22 - <unknown>\r\n  10:     0x55719bc9dcf1 - <unknown>\r\n  11:     0x55719bcc8cba - <unknown>\r\n  12:     0x55719bcd11e3 - <unknown>\r\n  13:     0x55719bcbdd67 - <unknown>\r\n  14:     0x55719bc58144 - <unknown>\r\n  15:     0x7f7e8a8fcd65 - <unknown>\r\n  16:     0x7f7e8a8fcffc - wl_display_dispatch_queue_pending\r\n  17:     0x55719b9ba91a - <unknown>\r\n  18:     0x55719b9b9d71 - <unknown>\r\n  19:     0x55719b99533c - <unknown>\r\n  20:     0x55719b9016da - <unknown>\r\n  21:     0x55719b9b1245 - <unknown>\r\n  22:     0x55719b9c9b12 - <unknown>\r\n  23:     0x55719b957ec3 - <unknown>\r\n  24:     0x55719b9c62b4 - <unknown>\r\n  25:     0x7f7e8a4c5290 - <unknown>\r\n  26:     0x7f7e8a4c534a - __libc_start_main\r\n  27:     0x55719b8c00b5 - <unknown>\r\n  28:                0x0 - <unknown>\r\n[wayland-client error] A handler for wl_keyboard panicked.\r\n[1]    20807 IOT instruction (core dumped)  RUST_BACKTRACE=full alacritty -vv\r\n```\r\nThe entire log is attached here\r\n[alacritty-log.txt](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/9995695/alacritty-log.txt)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6487/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
