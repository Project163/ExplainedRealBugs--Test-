behavior is the same for both my laptop keyboard and an external USB keyboard.\r\n\r\nA less ideal work-around would be to map Caps Lock to `ToggleViMode` directly, but I can't seem to be able to map Caps Lock at all.\r\n\r\nApart from this issue, Alacritty is working great for me so thanks all the good work done!\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.5.0-dev
