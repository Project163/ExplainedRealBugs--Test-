I could easily produce this with fcitx so I don't think it's related to the fcitx5 using a new xim implmentation via xcb-imdkit. \r\n1. Type something in the terminal\r\n2. Press Ctrlt +Alt +H to trigger the spell check in fcitx (normally you should see a notification on desktop)\r\n3. Press left\r\n4. type \"app\"\r\n5. Use mouse to select the candidate, only \"pp\" got typed into alacritty.\r\n\r\nSo I think the tricky part to reproduce it is that you can't press any modifier key between step 3. 4. 5, otherwise the bug could not be triggered.\r\n\r\nI actually suggest you try this:\r\nhttps://github.com/fcitx/xcb-imdkit/\r\n\r\ncompile it with standard cmake procedure (need xcb, xcb-util, xcb-util-keysyms, should be generally available on any distribution), no need to make install it.\r\n```\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake # or possibly ninja if cmake decide to use ninja instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter compile it you should be able to find test_server under build/test directory.\r\n\r\nFirst run `./test_server`\r\n\r\nThen start alacritty with\r\n`XMODIFIERS=@im=test_server alacritty`\r\n\r\nThen press \"Ctrl+Space\" in alacritty, check if press \"t\" will produce \"hello world你好世界켐ㅇㄹ貴方元気？☺\".\r\nIf so, then it's working, then you can reproduce it with\r\n1. Press Left\r\n2. Press \"t'\r\n3. only \"ello world你好世界켐ㅇㄹ貴方元気？☺\" is committed to the alacritty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/748708626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wengxt","id":259684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/259684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt","html_url":"https://github.com/wengxt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengxt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4133922713,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEzMzkyMjcxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4133922713","actor":{"login":"im","id":12029165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI5MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12029165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/im","html_url":"https://github.com/im","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-21T01:25:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4133922715,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMzM5MjI3MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4133922715","actor":{"login":"im","id":12029165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI5MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12029165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/im","html_url":"https://github.com/im","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/im/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-21T01:25:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/752147377","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4588#issuecomment-752147377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4588","id":752147377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjE0NzM3Nw==","user":{"login":"zerovip","id":8308347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8308347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip","html_url":"https://github.com/zerovip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerovip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-29T16:30:28Z","updated_at":"2020-12-29T16:30:28Z","body":"I ran into the same problem, with ibus + rime.

I hit right arrow key\r\n\r\nOooooh, right. Now I finally understand it. That's what is triggering the key binding and that's exactly what is causing the problem. Arrow keys are implemented using keybindings, but since they don't generate any `ReceivedCharacter` events the suppression for the binding is never released. So then when the IME text shows up the first character releases the key suppression.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch for that, fix should be trivial now.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/752384421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4156698150,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDE1NjY5ODE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4156698150","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T09:11:03Z","label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"159818"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4156698152,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxNTY2OTgxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4156698152","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T09:11:03Z","label":{"name":"D -
