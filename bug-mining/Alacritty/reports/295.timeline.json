work the same compared to e.g. kitty/foot when I look into the generated events.\r\n\r\nWith `ctrl + [` you're actually right. `alacritty <0.13` matches the behaviour of eg. `xterm` or `gnome-terminal` and not `foot`/`kitty` and there it works. I guess it's because of the protocol you've mentioned although I'm not familiar with it to understand all the implications. Could you elaborate a little bit more? Can it be tweaked/turned off? Manual binding seems to solve it\r\n\r\nFTR:\r\n```\r\n# Bind ^[ to ESC everywhere\r\nmap global insert <c-[> <esc>\r\nmap global normal <c-[> <esc>\r\nmap global prompt <c-[> <esc>\r\nmap global menu

vanilla editor configurations :( Feels like [1172](https://xkcd.com/1172/) case.\r\n\r\nHowever, `alt + K`, `alt + !`, `alt + shift + /`, `alt + N` etc. seems to work correctly & same in `kitty`, `foot`, `xterm`, `gnome-terminal` and `alacritty pre-0.13` but not on

I'm using `kakoune v2023.07.29`. I don't know which version they ship on Fedora. Even more variables in the equation unfortunately :/\r\n\r\n> This should fix it https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/7493\r\n\r\nI'll check now, thanks for a quick feedback :) ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1872307807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glaeqen","id":80407822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDA3ODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80407822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen","html_url":"https://github.com/glaeqen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1872310839","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7492#issuecomment-1872310839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7492","id":1872310839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85vmTI3","user":{"login":"glaeqen","id":80407822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDA3ODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80407822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen","html_url":"https://github.com/glaeqen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaeqen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-29T20:00:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-29T20:00:42Z","body":"Patch seems to fix the issue with the `alt + shift` 👍🏻 I'm still wondering why in the old kakoune `ctrl + [` works just fine, very curious.
