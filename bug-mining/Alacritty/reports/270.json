I ran `alacritty migrate` as instructed, but it failed with:\r\n```\r\nConfiguration file migration failed:\r\n    \"/home/user/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml\": parsing error: Unable to locate config file\r\n```\r\nObviously, the file is there. There is a parsing error, but the exact cause seems to be misreported.\r\n\r\nAfter playing with it a bit, I found that running `alacritty migrate -i` (skipping imports) succeeds. The only import in my yaml was `colorscheme.yml`. To be honest, I don't remember what exactly that is, but I've decided to create this issue, because `Unable to locate config file` is misleading and maybe this will help other people.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that `migrate` fails with a vague error on a [former valid config](https://github.com/Randoragon/dotfiles/blob/b45d7534595d6e3cc6550d616294f8e5bb4c49a4/alacritty/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml). I don't mean this to come off as picky though, thanks for taking the effort of making this migration smooth!\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Arch Linux, X11, bspwm, picom\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.13.0 (78fa4d6f)","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7473/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
