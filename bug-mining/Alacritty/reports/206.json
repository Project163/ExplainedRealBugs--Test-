What's perhaps more interesting is that when I scroll half of the page via `<C-d>` only the bottom part of the window flickers, while top one does not. This issue is observed both inside and outside of tmux. Other terminal emulators don't have this issue.\r\n\r\n* My `alacritty` is built with `cargo` from sources, repo at commit d5ab4183c69e37e8d309acf7b38c2071106bceb7.\r\n* OS: Arch linux with kernel `4.10.13-1-ARCH`\r\n* Graphics:\r\n  * drivers: `intel (unloaded: modesetting)`\r\n  * GLX Renderer: `Mesa DRI Intel Ivybridge Mobile`\r\n  * GLX Version: `3.0 Mesa 17.1.0`\r\n\r\nI have also reproduced it on a different machine, with nvidia's GPU, alas low in terms of performance:\r\n\r\n* The same repository commit (d5ab4183c69e37e8d309acf7b38c2071106bceb7)\r\n* OS: Arch linux kernel `4.11.2-1-ARCH`\r\n* Graphics:  \r\n  * driver: `nvidia`\r\n  * GLX Renderer: `Quadro 600/PCIe/SSE2`\r\n  * GLX Version: `4.5.0 NVIDIA 381.22`\r\n  * Direct Rendering: `Yes`\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what could be a problem here? This issue prevents me from using `alacritty` on a daily basis, because said flashing constantly distracts me.\r\n\r\nThis problem is also mentioned in #555","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
