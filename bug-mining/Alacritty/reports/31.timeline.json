the viewport is scrolled, the selection is rotated to make sure\r\nthat it moves with the viewport. However this did not correctly handle\r\nthe underflow that happens when the selection goes below 0.\r\n\r\nThis resolves that problem for the selection by moving the internal line\r\nrepresentation to an isize, thus correctly keeping track of the\r\nselection start/end points even when they have a negative index. Once\r\nthe selection is converted to a span, the lines are clamped to the\r\nvisible region.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1640 and fixes #1643.\r\n\r\nNote that this currently breaks semantic and line selection because\r\nthe necessary adjustments to handle `isize`s haven't been made in their\r\nspan methods yet. This should be fairly simple, however opening a\r\ntemporary PR here should prevent unnecessary duplicated effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1916387526,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MTYzODc1MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1916387526","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cc57b6c563c86ec54f268f2153dad6139324461","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/6cc57b6c563c86ec54f268f2153dad6139324461","created_at":"2018-10-20T21:07:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1916411986,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkxNjQxMTk4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1916411986","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-20T22:31:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1916412031,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MTY0MTIwMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1916412031","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4380d0864b1098909bdcfec132b866c34924517e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/4380d0864b1098909bdcfec132b866c34924517e","created_at":"2018-10-20T22:31:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/431806225","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1640#issuecomment-431806225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1640","id":431806225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTgwNjIyNQ==","user":{"login":"haarp","id":781030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/781030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp","html_url":"https://github.com/haarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/followers","following_url":"https://ap
