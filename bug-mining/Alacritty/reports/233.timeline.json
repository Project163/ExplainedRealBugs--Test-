have noticed different behavior of when the WindowEvent::Focused(bool) event is dispatched, depending whether you are on Windows or MacOS.\r\n\r\nI've modified the [multiwindow example here to illustrate these differences:](https://github.com/hardiesoft/winit/blob/focus_on_creation_issue/examples/multiwindow.rs)\r\n\r\nOn running the example on windows I get the following output:\r\nNew window WindowId(WindowId(0x40e7a))\r\nNew window WindowId(WindowId(0x30edc))\r\nLost focus: WindowId(WindowId(0x40e7a))\r\n\r\nOn macos, I get:\r\nNew window WindowId(Id(140494821671056))\r\nNew window WindowId(Id(140494818628096))\r\nGot focus: WindowId(Id(140494818628096))\r\n\r\nThe windows example seems more wrong than the macos example, since we never get an event for the second window that gained focus when the first window lost it.\r\n\r\nDepending on your point of view though, the macos example could also be wrong if we're aiming for consistency with the model that each window gains focus when it is created, and loses it when another one is created afterwards.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put together a PR for this issue, but I'd first like to start some discussion around what the correct behavior should be.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I also think winit is missing an APIs to programmatically set window focus and to control stacking order of windows.  If it's agreed that those pieces of functionality are in scope for winit, then I'll write up issues for them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1077/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/570072980","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3139#issuecomment-570072980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3139","id":570072980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDA3Mjk4MA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-01T18:23:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T18:23:02Z","body":"See
