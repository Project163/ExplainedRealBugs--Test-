Since this was the October update, I thought the version number would be 1810 (2018.10).\r\n\r\nIf that version is present (1809), then the ConPTY option will work and is available.\r\n\r\nCould the people who are able to reproduce share a bit more information about how to reproduce this? I feel like this would be a pretty simple bug to fix, but unfortunately I can not reproduce it. It would be interesting to get some information about the system, is this reproducible with both mouse and touchpad? Does it matter which other application is open?\r\n\r\nSince it might not be trivial for me to fix it, this would probably be a great issue for someone interested in trying to contribute to Alacritty. I can help with getting started if someone is willing to dive in.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/473982772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2210927025,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMTA5MjcwMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2210927025","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-18T16:13:01Z","label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"159818"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/474093414","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2170#issuecomment-474093414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2170","id":474093414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDA5MzQxNA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T20:44:44Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T20:44:44Z","body":"Turns out I've managed to reproduce it.

trying to fix https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/2170, I've just noticed that the event order of the `Focused` event is a bit different on Windows compared to the other platforms.\r\n\r\nEven though window focus on Windows can only be changed when clicking on a window, the `Focused` events comes *before* the `MouseInput` event. They aren't coming in the same bulk either so the order isn't only messed up but they're coming in completely disconnected from each other in short succession.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this is that it makes it impossible to determine if a `MouseInput` event was on a focused or unfocused window. So clicks on unfocused windows can't easily be ignored.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is an issue with winit or a constraint due to the Windows API, but this is probably the best place to ask.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/817/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2211870456,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMTE4NzA0NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2211870456","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-18T21:59:26Z","label":{"name":"S
