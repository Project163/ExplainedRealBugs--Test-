The whole application freezes. The CPU usage is 0% so I assume some kind of deadlock.\r\n\r\nIt's been a problem for a few months; not sure when it got introduced. I'd wondered about looking into it myself, but don't have the time right now. I might take a look in the New Year if it's still an issue then.\r\n\r\nI'm running powershell as my shell. ConPTY backend.\r\n\r\n(I'd been waiting for the glutin event loop update to land in case that fixed it. Then saw some similar work for WinPTY which I wondered if would fix it - doesn't seem to have helped.)\r\n\r\nSee example in this GIF (goes to not responding right at the end):\r\n\r\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/facca0b47b773434d52e3c70c547b091.gif)](https://gyazo.com/facca0b47b773434d52e3c70c547b091)","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
