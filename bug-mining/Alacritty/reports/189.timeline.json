video drivers could set display metrics to odd values, which can result in\r\nextra large scale factors (e.g. winit is sending 720 for 5k screen on nvidia\r\nbinary drivers), so let's just drop them to prevent clients from using them.\r\nThe value 20 was picked, because the DPR for 8k @ 5 inch is ~18.36.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n- [x] Compilation warnings were addressed\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt` has been run on this branch\r\n- [x] `cargo doc` builds successfully\r\n- [x] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n- [ ] Created or updated an example program if it would help users understand this functionality\r\n- [ ] Updated [feature matrix](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/FEATURES.md), if new features were added or implemented\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is more of a proposal. The original issue was here https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3214 , as you can see in a log, DPR from winit is 718, which is literally insane. I see 2 options on how to fix such issues.\r\n\r\n1 - Make winit compute DPI only if a randr value in use, otherwise return just 1 all the time. Qt is probably doing something similar IIRC\r\n2 - Just try to ignore odd values (this PR is doing it).\r\n\r\nThe proposed `1` change is a breaking change, so I guess `2` option should fix some problems right now, however I feel like we should also implement `1` at some point to be more `native`, since auto DPI adjustments aren't something common for X11.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"juanibiapina","id":568764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODc2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina","html_url":"https://github.com/juanibiapina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanibiapina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-22T14:08:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T14:08:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3500","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3500/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3500/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3500/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3500","id":585726415,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODU3MjY0MTU=","number":3500,"title":"Crash

System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux 5.5.9\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.4.2-rc4\r\nLinux/BSD: X11, i3wm\r\nScreens: 1920x1080, 5120x1440 (in xinerama)\r\n### Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen the Alacritty window spawns on my larger display (5120x1440) the glyph cache takes an absurdly long time to generate. Then, once it's done generating, Alacritty opens a window painted with the background color (as defined in alacritty.yml) but never renders anything else.\r\n\r\nIf the Alacritty window spawns on a smaller screen (1920x1080), it works perfectly. But if I move the window to my larger display, the application ceases to be interactive, even if I move it back to the smaller screen.\r\n\r\nPutting the window into floating mode doesn't help.\r\n\r\nUsing `pstree` I can tell that alacritty *is* launching a shell (/bin/zsh) in all cases.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n#### Spawning on 5120x1440 \r\n```txt\r\n% /usr/bin/alacritty

not sure if I should be posting this question here or on bspwm's github/reddit.\r\n\r\nMy problem appears when I set my monitor's resolution to 5120x1440 at which point alacritty's entire area becomes black (on both already running alacritty and a newly opened one).\r\n\r\n I'd like to add that this problem doesn't affect konsole (the KDE terminal), however if i first open konsole, then alacritty, then change resolution - both terminals get borked (konsole shows some white rectangle too, but no text is visible in either terminal). If konsole is opened alone then it adjusts properly to the new resolution.\r\n\r\nI'm using bspwm as my window manager. I also have full KDE desktop installed and on the Xorg version there is no problem with alacritty on the aforementioned resolution.\r\n\r\nIs there some magical environment variable that I should be setting?\r\n\r\nFrom the logs below it seems that alacritty sets some crazy padding (2873 x 2843) on 5120x1440 resolution while on lower resolution 3840x1080 for example it reads the padding properly from my config file (4 pixels each dimension). Same with width/height - they are both very high (definitely much higher than my monitor's resolution).\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Void Linux\r\nVersion: 0.4.2\r\nLinux: X11, bspwm, no compositor (problem occurs with picom enabled too)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nCrashes: none\r\nFont/Terminal size: `alacritty -vv`\r\n```\r\n[2020-04-03 19:41:17.613215023] [INFO] Welcome to Alacritty\r\n[2020-04-03

been using Alacritty just fine on a standard high definition 1920x1080 monitor. I've recently being trying to use Alacritty on my superwide 32:9 monitor with a resolution of 5120x1440 but for some reason Alacritty takes over 40 seconds to load and is completely unusable when it loads. Blank screen and no command prompt. The compositing still works and I can see the background wallpaper.\r\n\r\nAlso, my superwide monitor has the option to be run as two separate monitors of 2560x1440 - when in this mode Alacritty on the same computer and everything else being the same starts up in under a second and is just fine, no problem. I'm not sure what it is about the superwide 5120 setting that causes the issue? Just wanted to report this, I could'n't see any similar reports or anything in the documentation about this so apologies if I've missed something.\r\n[alacritty.yml.txt](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/5179525/alacritty.yml.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux - Arch Linux x64\r\nKernel - 5.8.6-arch1-1\r\nCPU -
