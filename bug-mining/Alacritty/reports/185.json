The column command in a normal window works. But the column command doesn't seem to work when launched with `alacritty --hold -e bash -c'...`.~~\r\n\r\n~~It used to work but recently I found it seems to have broken. Now the window is just blank.~~\r\n\r\nWhen running a command at startup and passing the `--hold` option, the PTY is not always read entirely. Commands like `alacritty --hold -e echo test` often do not print the text written to the PTY. Adding a little `sleep` fixes the problem, so it's likely a problem with the PTY being dropped before it is read entirely since usually without the `--hold` option it's not important to read all of it.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
