It looks like alacritty depends on [glutin](https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/) which for linux depends on [winit](https://github.com/tomaka/winit) and I found the following lines are commented out in the most recent version [src/api/x11/events.rs#L177](https://github.com/tomaka/winit/blob/master/src/api/x11/events.rs#L177) and [src/api/x11/events.rs#L270](https://github.com/tomaka/winit/blob/master/src/api/x11/events.rs#L270).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be relevant to my issue but I am unsure why it has been commented out. If this is the reason then the layout of my keyboard is irrelevant and most likely other linux users would have the same problem.\r\n\r\nHaving encountered the issue while using alacritty I'm submitting an issue here but should I also post an issue on winit? Or is there another reason for this issue?","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/55/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
