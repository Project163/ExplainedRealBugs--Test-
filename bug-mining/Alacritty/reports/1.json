The input thread simply writes to the file descriptor when it has data to write. The only way to test if this is true would be implementing an actual event loop for I/O. The easiest way to do that is dropping mio into the pty thread and sending all writes from the input handling over the mio channel.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
