For example, when this is in my `alacritty.yml`:\r\n```yml\r\nfont:\r\n  normal:\r\n    family: Fira Code\r\n    style: Regular\r\n  size: 11.0\r\n```\r\nand I don't have Fira Code installed, Alacritty will simply not open. Running Alacritty from the command line with the `-v` flag reveals why:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Program Files\\Alacritty> .\\alacritty.exe -v\r\nPS C:\\Program Files\\Alacritty> Created log file at \"C:\\Users\\private\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Alacritty-17208.log\"\r\n[2020-07-06 12:39:07.895761700] [INFO] Welcome to Alacritty\r\n[2020-07-06 12:39:07.896759300] [INFO] Configuration loaded from \"C:\\Users\\private\\AppData\\Roaming\\alacritty\\alacritty.yml\"\r\nAlacritty encountered an unrecoverable error:\r\n\r\n        Couldn't find a font with name Fira Code and style Regular\r\n        Please check the font config in your alacritty.yml.\r\n```\r\nIt works fine once Fira Code is installed, but in the case where you copy over a config file to a new computer (where an uninstalled font is specified in the config), it can be difficult to diagnose why Alacritty doesn't open - I for example didn't know what the issue was until I found out that I could run the executable with the `-v` flag. It's very confusing if nothing happens when Alacritty is run (without flags).\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to new users if Alacritty either\r\n - produced an error window specifying the issue or\r\n - reverted to the default font and showed the error in the bottom like it does with other errors.\r\n\r\n### System\r\nOS: Windows\r\nVersion: `alacritty 0.4.3 (c723247)`\r\nWindows: ConPTY","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
