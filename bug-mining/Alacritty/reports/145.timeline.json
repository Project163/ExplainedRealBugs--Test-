Description\r\nThis is a proposed fix for https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2800 and https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2566.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nAlacritty was handling locale in a way which could lead to troubles when not setting any locales in your `bashrc`, `zshrc` or similar when running on Mac OS. Without setting any locales Alacritty would output the following:\r\n```\r\n$ locale\r\nLANG=\"\"\r\nLC_COLLATE=\"C\"\r\nLC_CTYPE=\"C\"\r\nLC_MESSAGES=\"C\"\r\nLC_MONETARY=\"C\"\r\nLC_NUMERIC=\"C\"\r\nLC_TIME=\"C\"\r\nLC_ALL=\r\n```\r\nThis however gave problems with some `UTF-8` characters (like the nordic `æ`, `ø` and `å`). Looking at the output from the same command on both `Terminal.app` and `iTerm` shows a difference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ locale\r\nLANG=\"\"\r\nLC_COLLATE=\"C\"\r\nLC_CTYPE=\"UTF-8\"\r\nLC_MESSAGES=\"C\"\r\nLC_MONETARY=\"C\"\r\nLC_NUMERIC=\"C\"\r\nLC_TIME=\"C\"\r\nLC_ALL=\r\n```\r\nThe key here is that they are both falling back to `LC_CTYPE=\"UTF-8\"`. `LC_CTYPE` is defined as:\r\n\r\n> LC_CTYPE\r\nThis category applies to classification and conversion of characters, and to multibyte and wide characters\r\n\r\n[Source](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Locale-Categories.html).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI propose we introduce a fallback `LC_CTYPE` value. This value should be `UTF-8`. Right now the code is trying to calculate `LANG` based on `NSLocale` from Core Foundation. While doing this we use a trick where we try to set the given locale, to see if it's a valid locale. We do it this way:\r\n\r\nFirst we save the original `LC_CTYPE`.\r\n```rust\r\nlet original = setlocale(LC_CTYPE, null());\r\nlet saved_original = if original.is_null() {\r\n    CString::new(\"\").unwrap()\r\n} else {\r\n    CStr::from_ptr(original).to_owned()\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have to verify the locale we found to see if it's valid to propagate to `LANG`:\r\n```rust\r\nlet modified = setlocale(LC_CTYPE, locale_ptr);\r\nlet result = if modified.is_null() { String::new() } else { locale_id };\r\nsetlocale(LC_CTYPE, saved_original.as_ptr());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd after this, the `result` will be passed to `LANG` like this: `env::set_var(\"LANG\", &locale_id);`\r\nThe issue happens when we reset the `LC_CTYPE` on the last line, in the previous block. We reset it to the default value, hence we don't have a fallback solution.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that we still do the check to see if the locale is valid, but then not resetting back to the original `LC_CTYPE` but back to a `UTF-8`. Remember this is a case which only happens when the user is not providing any locales them self. If setting `LC_CTYPE` to something different in `alacritty.yml` it will still use that value. Ditto if overwriting locale in `bashrc`, `zshrc`, or similar it will use that.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3290712838,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI5MDcxMjgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3290712838","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"7901b454ee04c7873e611986ed2dbe5c3d6331eb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/7901b454ee04c7873e611986ed2dbe5c3d6331eb","created_at":"2020-04-30T18:04:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/622014887","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2800#issuecomment-622014887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2800","id":622014887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjAxNDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T18:08:20Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T18:08:20Z","body":"I'm
