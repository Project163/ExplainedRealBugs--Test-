To make it possible to detect if a terminal does not support it, I also append a second just general DA1 query, so that I can see in the response immediately if I only get a response for that, so I conclude that the terminal can't answer the first and don't have to wait until I reach some timeout.\r\n\r\nHowever, alacritty is answering these requests out of order: Below you see first the background color request followed by the `\\033[c` DA1 query.\r\nThe response to the DA1 query arrives first and a few moments later the response to the background color arrives.\r\n\r\n#### Actual result: responses out of sequence\r\n```\r\necho -e \"\\e]11;?\\e\\\\\\\\\\e[c\"\r\n^[[?6c^[]11;rgb:1d1d/1f1f/2121^[\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected result: responses in sequence of query\r\nI'd expect that the result would be in sequence of the queries:\r\n```\r\n^[]11;rgb:1d1d/1f1f/2121^[\\^[[?6c\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this out-of-sequence response, my plan to use it as a detection if a specialized query is supported of course won't work as intended.\r\n\r\nIs out-of-order response generally something that I have to expect from a terminal emulator or is this particular issue a bug in alacritty ?\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: `alacritty 0.8.0-dev (a954e07)`  _compiled from head_\r\nLinux/BSD: X11\r\n\r\n(Context: I intend to use the double-query in http://timg.sh/ to be able to quickly detect terminals that don't have the background color query feature)","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
