The length is correct but after the text gets passed into `clipboard.set_contents()` it's truncated again\r\n- I've created a minimal test app using the example code and the same `include_str!(\"clip.txt\")` of [copypasta/examples/hello_world.rs](https://github.com/alacritty/copypasta/blob/94e44c83dbaf08582309b297f0ae3b1b8cd1b17c/examples/hello_world.rs) and that does actually works as expected, the clipboard is not truncated.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Build & Run\r\n- Generate output larger then about 65k chars, I used `journalctl --since today --no-pager`\r\n- Select all\r\n- Copy to clipboard using default keybinding `Ctrl+Shift+C`\r\n- Paste clipboard into other application, i.e. VS Code or gedit\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux - Fedora 37 Workstation (Gnome3 Wayland)\r\n\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.12.0 (via `cargo install alacritty`) and alacritty 0.13.0-dev (commit d40198da53f4c1c882901e364aca59e9b2ef2367)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nCrashes: N/A\r\n\r\nConfig: [alacritty.txt](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/11184617/alacritty.txt)\r\n\r\nFont/Terminal size: `alacritty -vv` -> [Alacritty.log](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/11184609/Alacritty.log)\r\n\r\nKeyboard and bindings: `alacritty --print-events` -> [Alacritty.log](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/files/11184607/Alacritty.log)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
