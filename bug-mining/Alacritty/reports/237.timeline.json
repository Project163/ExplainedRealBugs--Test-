Ah, so that's what is causing it...

Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm not @chrisnc of course, but here's my suggestion: If there's no equivalent for `-a` in POSIX sh, then `/bin/sh` should be replaced with `/bin/zsh` (just tested it and it works) in the command (it could be replaced with `/bin/bash` too, but macOS's Bash is ancient, and I reckon it might be even removed in the future).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1285787136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"triallax","id":32234660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjM0NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32234660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax","html_url":"https://github.com/triallax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/triallax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7632642749,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85UbkVbzwAAAAHG8OK9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7632642749","actor":{"login":"chrisnc","id":2592855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2592855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T15:49:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7632642765,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85UbkVbzwAAAAHG8OLN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7632642765","actor":{"login":"chrisnc","id":2592855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2592855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T15:49:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
