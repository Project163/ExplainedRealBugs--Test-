IL escape sequence (CSI Ps L) allows inserting blank, uninitialized\r\nlines. `Ps` is a placeholder for the number of lines that should be\r\ninserted. Before this change Alacritty would crash when a large number\r\nof lines was passed as `Ps` parameter.\r\n\r\nThe issue was caused whenever the current line of the cursor plus the\r\nlines that should be inserted would leave the bottom of the terminal,\r\nsince this makes indexing impossible.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes sure that the biggest amount of lines inserted does\r\nnever exceed the end of the visible region minus the current line of the\r\ncurser, which fixes the underflow issue.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1515.\r\n\r\n@jwilm I'd be interested in knowing what you think about this workaround.\r\nIt's not immediately obvious to me what exactly this escape sequence\r\nshould be used for. Even though the ecma documentation has some\r\ninformation on it. So I'm not entirely convinced yet that this is the correct\r\nbehavior for dealing with the `IL` escape parameter being out of bounds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1822070230,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4MjIwNzAyMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1822070230","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e0594695afcb96528b7eed6542615d07f0a1eb73","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/e0594695afcb96528b7eed6542615d07f0a1eb73","created_at":"2018-09-02T00:31:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1828943305,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4Mjg5NDMzMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1828943305","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"43882ade33d4c14ee7248e489a2d33395faaa0b1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/43882ade33d4c14ee7248e489a2d33395faaa0b1","created_at":"2018-09-05T21:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1850041570,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg1MDA0MTU3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1850041570","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"43882ade33d4c14ee7248e489a2d33395faaa0b1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/43882ade33d4c14ee7248e489a2d33395faaa0b1","created_at":"2018-09-17T15:15:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
