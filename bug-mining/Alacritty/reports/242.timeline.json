It's to the point I can no longer reproduce, but I am happy to advise you on doing the debugging if you're willing to get your hands dirty.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary threads in Alacritty: 1. the parser thread, and 2. the render/input thread. The parser thread reads from the pty asynchronously and locks the terminal struct once it's got some data. With lock in hand, the parser runs and updates what is visible on the screen. After the buffer is drained and terminal updated, this thread sends an event to the render/input thread which should trigger a wakeup. This all happens within [`EventLoop::pty_read`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/68cca6eb381f88e861439ed6a1dda1ab6a7429d3/src/event_loop.rs#L247-L301).\r\n\r\nYou might note that the render/input thread is only notified when the terminal `dirty` flag is not already set. As an initial sanity check, you might try disabling that check and always notify the render thread (this has a performance penalty which is why we don't already do it). At the same time, that might not actually be the problem and just change around timing enough to appear to solve the issue. Thus, this can be used to demonstrate that the dirty flag check is *not* the problem (would still have the issue), but it cannot conclusively conclude that it *is* the problem (issue might go away, but for different reason). In this latter case, you'll probably want to start adding some logging about when the render thread is kicked.\r\n\r\nThe part where this is consumed on the render thread starts in [_main.rs_](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/68cca6eb381f88e861439ed6a1dda1ab6a7429d3/src/main.rs#L168-L201). The first line in this loop\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut terminal = processor.process_events(&terminal, display.window());\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill usually block and wait for events. Note that further down the loop, there's a check\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif terminal.needs_draw() {\r\n    // draw\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo either this check would be returning false, or control never reaches this point.\r\n\r\nLooking at [`Processor::process_events`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/src/event.rs#L336), this method is either blocking or polling for events based on initial state. Your draw problem ends up with it stuck blocking for events and never waking up, so we'll want to check that out. I would recommend adding some logging in that area. Finally, you might want to add some logging where the [`Awakened` event is handled](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/68cca6eb381f88e861439ed6a1dda1ab6a7429d3/src/event.rs#L328).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help review the logs you generate or guide you through more of the code. Please let me know how else I can help; I would love to fully squash this bug, and I need help from someone like yourself to do it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/335839744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/335908985","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/824#issuecomment-335908985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/824","id":335908985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTkwODk4NQ==","user":{"login":"valff","id":12503689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAzNjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12503689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff","html_url":"https://github.com/valff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-11T18:44:25Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T18:44:25Z","body":"@jwilm Thanks for a great guidance!

How can it be?\r\n\r\n_Edit_: wrong frequency.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/345196198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"valff","id":12503689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAzNjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12503689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff","html_url":"https://github.com/valff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1346818303,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTM0NjgxODMwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1346818303","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-17T09:50:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1346818304,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzNDY4MTgzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1346818304","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-17T09:50:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/390011549","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/824#issuecomment-390011549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/824","id":390011549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDAxMTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"divoxx","id":2863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx","html_url":"https://github.com/divoxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divoxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T21:06:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T21:06:33Z","body":"This issue just started happening to me for the first time.

I started _Alacritty-scrollback_ from another terminal 20 or 30 times to repro this; once it's open and ready to use, it is not rendered properly after the resize adjustment for font metrics.\r\n#In photos below; first is how _Alacritty-scrollback_ looks when it opens and presents the bug. Second photo shows after I hit _ENTER_, it fixes the render.\r\nThe window is focused (freshly opened, focused) when this all is occur.\r\n\r\nPhoto to compare before _ENTER_ and after _ENTER_:\r\n![screenshot from 2018-04-29 06-07-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38713922/39405157-65452d36-4b76-11e8-8d1b-565a6966ad54.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2018-04-29
