would it be possible to support font options such as embolden and hinting for Linux fonts?

Antialiasing is on in each screenshot, the font is DejaVu Sans Mono, size 12 on urxvt, 9.5 on Alacritty (I don't know why those settings differ and how this factors in the issue here, but 9.5 seems to give me the same font size as my usual urxvt does).\r\n\r\nRenderer | rendered\r\n------------ | ------------\r\nAlacritty, hintfull | ![alacritty_hintfull](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2761682/86283685-bbbd4300-bbe1-11ea-8372-11065dd22139.png)\r\nurxvt, hintfull | ![urxvt_hintfull](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2761682/86283686-bc55d980-bbe1-11ea-8a9e-1170c307cf27.png)\r\nurxvt, hintmedium | ![urxvt_hintmedium](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2761682/86283689-bcee7000-bbe1-11ea-94e5-75cd55a18980.png)\r\nurxvt, hintslight | ![urxvt_hintslight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2761682/86283693-be1f9d00-bbe1-11ea-9065-af10e79bd42f.png)\r\nurxvt, hintnone | ![urxvt_hintnone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2761682/86283692-bd870680-bbe1-11ea-8f04-91c76ab279e8.png)\r\n\r\nThe difference is small, but noticeable. I also notice that Alacritty's render on hintfull doesn't match with any hint level with urxvt.\r\n\r\nI tried to see how the patch proposed in the first message of this issue changes the rendering, the code seems to have changed quite a bit since it was posted and applying it does not change anything (to my knowledge) to the rendering.\r\n\r\nI also tried to compare the load flags actually used on my setup in both Alacritty and urxvt on hintfull, they were the same (`0x0` in both case, the default). This is just my particular setup but load flags don't seem to be a problem.\r\n\r\nFor reference, some config files on my setup (archlinux, last git version of urxvt and Alacritty):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>.Xresources</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n!--------------------\r\n! rxvt-unicode\r\n\r\n!---------------------------------------------------------------!\r\n! .Xdefaults: kushou s main configuration file for rxvt-unicode !\r\n!---------------------------------------------------------------!\r\n!--------------------\r\n!
