Basically we shouldn't allow empty vertical block selections of width 0. This can cause a situation where it looks like there is no selection, but in fact there is one. Since a selection prevents actions like clicking a URL, this can lead to strange user interactions.\r\n\r\n![block-selection-url-bug-2019-09-07_00 03 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/715947/64469624-18a3b600-d103-11e9-91bb-0f7f675d2fda.gif)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce on master, create a 0 width N height block selection, and then attempt to click a URL. I believe a proper fix for this is to disallow 0 width block selections, similarly to how other selections disappear.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
