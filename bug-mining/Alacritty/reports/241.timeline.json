you run with `alacritty -o debug.highlight_damage=true` do you see pink rectangles covering non-damaged regions with tmux?\r\n\r\nI'm asking since I can't repro none of those issues and I tend to think that it's better to disable damage related stuff on

If you run with alacritty -o debug.highlight_damage=true do you see pink rectangles covering non-damaged regions with tmux?\r\n\r\nI am not sure what should be considered damaged or non-damaged in the context of tmux, but I can describe what I see in this way:\r\n\r\n- after doing a pane operation (creating a new pane, resizing, closing, etc.), sometimes the whole terminal is marked as pink, sometimes it is only briefly fully marked as pink, and then only the cursor regions and other updating regions of panes (e.g. continuously changing regions of an htop output) are marked with pink rectangles.\r\n\r\n- when doing a display modifying operation in a pane (e.g. running an 'ls') while nothing is going on in another pane, sometimes only the affected pane has pink rectangles where one could expect some to be, sometimes the whole terminal is pink, including the non-changing panes.\r\n\r\nAs a note, issues related to maximizing and resizing occur with or without running tmux in the terminal.\r\n\r\nAnd all the issues disappear when `debug.highlight_damage` is set.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1128176318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"someuser-blip2","id":63172412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTcyNDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63172412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2","html_url":"https://github.com/someuser-blip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someuser-blip2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1128213728","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6051#issuecomment-1128213728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6051","id":1128213728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85DPyzg","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-16T22:52:00Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T22:52:00Z","body":"Yeah,
