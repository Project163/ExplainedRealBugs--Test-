In Kitty, if an application crashes, I would have to disable Num Lock to be able to use the Backspace, Tab or Enter keys for recovery in the shell.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/2566753320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AThePeanut4","id":49614525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjE0NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49614525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4","html_url":"https://github.com/AThePeanut4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AThePeanut4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"strategictraveler","id":176749884,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoj9PA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176749884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler","html_url":"https://github.com/strategictraveler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strategictraveler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T14:10:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T14:10:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31831","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31831/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31831/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31831/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31831","id":2766090394,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPphoM6k3zCa","number":31831,"title":"Repeated
