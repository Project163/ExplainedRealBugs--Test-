I'm running irssi in an alacritty, and this is an excerpt of my session:\r\n\r\n13:17  * Grimes examines the latest issue of Stars and Stripes\r\n13:22 < ToCoTox> https://www.geologyin.com/2018/12/largest-known-diamond-in-north-america.html\r\n13:22  * ShowTitle <Title> Largest Known Diamond in North America Found\r\n\r\nIt just so happens that the URL in the middle line ends **EXACTLY** in the last column of the terminal.  When I click the link to open it, alacritty does not realize that the URL ends there, and wraps around and grabs the timestamp from the next line and appends it to the URL, which then does not resolve because largest-known-diamond-in-north-america.html13:22 does not exist.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain how alacritty can best detect this condition.  Clearly I can work around it **in this use case** by making my URL handler strip anything that looks like an Irssi timestamp off the end of the URL, but that's not going to work for everyone.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
