Can you get it to crash when clicking on non-url text? Or when selecting text? That would indicate that the clicking itself is the problem and nothing URL related.\r\n\r\nIf it is URL related then there are two options really. Either it's related to URL parsing, or it's related to launching the URL. You can try setting the `launcher` to `None` (as documented in the config file) and that should disable URL launching.

to shorten the feedback loop a bit, I've got two more things I'd like you to try if moving the setsid does not work.:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[cfg(not(windows))]\r\npub fn start_daemon<I, S>(program: &str, args: I) -> io::Result<()>\r\n    where\r\n        I: IntoIterator<Item = S>,\r\n        S: AsRef<OsStr>,\r\n{\r\n    Command::new(program)\r\n        .args(args)\r\n        .stdin(Stdio::null())\r\n        .stdout(Stdio::null())\r\n        .stderr(Stdio::null())\r\n        .before_exec(|| unsafe {\r\n            daemon();\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        })\r\n        .spawn()?\r\n        .wait()\r\n        .map(|_| ())\r\n}\r\n\r\nunsafe fn daemon() -> isize {\r\n    match libc::fork() {\r\n        -1 => return -1,\r\n        0 => (),\r\n        _ => std::process::exit(0),\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if libc::setsid() == -1 {\r\n        -1\r\n    } else {\r\n        0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a 1:1 copy of glibc's daemon method assuming it's called with the parameters `1, 1`, so if daemon doesn't crash, neither should this.\r\n\r\nAnd just to make sure the issue isn't the callsite and the problem is unrelated to redirection of stdout/in/err, this is worth another shot:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[cfg(not(windows))]\r\npub fn start_daemon<I, S>(program: &str, args: I) -> io::Result<()>\r\n    where\r\n        I: IntoIterator<Item = S>,\r\n        S: AsRef<OsStr>,\r\n{\r\n    Command::new(program)\r\n        .args(args)\r\n        .stdin(Stdio::null())\r\n        .stdout(Stdio::null())\r\n        .stderr(Stdio::null())\r\n        .before_exec(|| unsafe {\r\n            libc::daemon(1, 1);\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        })\r\n        .spawn()?\r\n        .wait()\r\n        .map(|_| ())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to help with troubleshooting and testing these three things, that would help a lot. Unfortunately everything's working great on my system.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these give any new insights, I think it would be fine to just revert the code and suppress the deprecation warning, since macos hasn't actually deprecated `daemon` but is just discouraging its use.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/478198248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241583641,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTU4MzY0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2241583641","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-31T14:36:44Z","milestone":{"title":"Version
