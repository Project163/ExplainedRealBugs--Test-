#2081 (?)\r\n\r\nI want to start a bigger feature contribution but I needed some easy task to get familiar with the codebase.

Let me know what you guys think.\r\n\r\nTested it locallly , worked as expected.\r\n- [x] test manually clear action (`zellij action clear` for a trashed pane)\r\n- [x] write a dedicated test for it (not sure I did it clean here)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2239/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
