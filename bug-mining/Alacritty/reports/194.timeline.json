It starts happening when the window is larger, typically 50+ columns.\r\n\r\nI only see this happening on one particular machine - a brand new Dell XPS 13 (9310) - which has a lot of teething problems anyway, such as poorly supported networking, power management, and what seems like instability with the i915 drivers, though where exactly in the stack that is I don't know.

Of course I'm open for questions if you have any.\r\n\r\n~~Generally they `Input` itself shouldn't matter, since of course all input goes through the PTY before mutating the grid state.~~\r\n\r\n~~So for input to be relevant, there should be a `Wakeup` after it has been processed. It might be necessary to put debug statements on the wakeup send and receive end to see if the wakeup coming after the PTY update might just be dropped.~~\r\n\r\nOh, I think I just realized the bug.
