So i'm reluctant to open a PR, because i expect whatever i come up would be highly unidiomatic. \r\n\r\nBasically csi_dispatch in ansi.rs would need to include `intermediates` in addition to `action` in the matching. With almost all matches only triggering if `intermediates` is empty.\r\n\r\nThe 'q' match would need to be modified to match on `action == 'q' && intermediates == [' ']`.\r\nThe matches for 'l' (reset mode) and 'h' (set mode) would need to work with both `intermediates == []` and `intermediates == ['?']` but the modes are different namespaces (i.e. `\\e[12h` is [send receive mode](https://terminalguide.netlify.com/mode/12/) while `\\e[?12h` is [cursor blinking mode](https://terminalguide.netlify.com/mode/p12/))\r\n\r\nI think alacritty might work with just those sequences. One step more would be to think about the other combination from my start post and thinking about what alacritty should respond to \"Secondary Device Attributes\" (`\\e[>c`).\r\n\r\nIf you want to see which sequences (`action` + `intermediates`) other terminals support the documentation for vte (gnome-terminal, etc) at https://terminalguide.netlify.com/seq/ is fairly complete (all toplevel CSI sequences are listed and most have a description).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help reviewing a possible PR for this, or course.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this currently causes bugs in the wild, i would expect software that does terminal identification based on responses to get confused by getting a \"Primary Device Attributes\" when asking for \"Secondary Device Attributes\".

does.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/488795481/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"textshell","id":6579711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzk3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6579711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell","html_url":"https://github.com/textshell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/textshell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T20:04:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T20:04:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652","id":469467284,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Njk0NjcyODQ=","number":2652,"title":"Certain

Linux**\r\n**Wayland**\r\n**alacritty 0.3.3**\r\n\r\nSome private CSI sequences don't behave like in other major terminal emulators (lxterminal, etc.).\r\n\r\nFrom [An issue encountered with ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/issues/28)\r\n\r\n>Thank you for the information! I took a glance at the codes of alacritty. The DA1 response is issued here (alacritty/mod.rs) which is called from here (alacritty/ansi.rs). It seems that the alacritty doesn't check intermediate bytes of CSI sequences and just sees the last byte to determine the control function associated with the CSI sequence. So alacritty cannot distinguish DA2 request (CSI > c) and even DA3 request (CSI = c) from DA / DA1 request (CSI c).\r\n\r\n>>maybe it is a bug in alacritty not responding to the escape sequence properly, maybe a bug report should be made to them too?\r\n\r\n>I'm not sure if it should be regarded as a \"bug\" of alacritty because there is no formal standard for these \"private CSI sequences\". DA is defined in so-called \"ANSI Standard\" (ANSI X3.64, ECMA-48 and ISO/IEC 6429), but the CSI sequences that starts with <, =, >, ? are designated as \"private sequences\" and the meaning can be defined by implementations. In this sense, if it's the design of alacritty, it's not a bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"akinomyoga","id":8982192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODIxOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8982192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga","html_url":"https://github.com/akinomyoga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akinomyoga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-20T15:09:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T15:09:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2664","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2664/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2664/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2664/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/2664","id":470684210,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjk5NTcwNDk4","number":2664,"title":"Ignore
