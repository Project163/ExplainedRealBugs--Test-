It seems like we call `set_mouse_visible(true)` when Alacritty *loses* focus.\r\n\r\nHere is what I found out:\r\n1. When a user starts typing, `set_mouse_visible(false)`, and `Window.mouse_visible` is set to `false` accordingly. The mouse is invisible.\r\n2. When Alacritty loses focus, `set_mouse_visible(true)` is called, and `Window.mouse_visible` is set to `true` accordingly. The mouse is visible in the other app.\r\n3. When the user switch back to Alacritty, the mouse is **hidden** somehow, which breaks the mouse visible state tracking. I think issue only happens on macOS, since the bug could not be reproduced on my linux machine. When the user starts to give cursor input, `set_mouse_visible(true)` is called, however with `Window.mouse_visible` still being `true`, so `set_cursor_visible(true)` is never called in winit.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/578e08486dfcdee0b2cd0e7a66752ff50edc46b8/alacritty/src/event.rs#L1213-L1219\r\n\r\nI tried changing the logic to:\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n if is_focused { \r\n     self.ctx.window().set_urgent(false); \r\n     self.ctx.window().set_mouse_visible(true); \r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\nthen I did a bit of testing, and it seems the bug is fixed. In this bug report's step 5, the mouse is visible with input from the touchpad or mouse. This fix seems to work fine all other platforms. However, I am not sure if there is more complications on this. My concern is if we **really** want to show the cursor when a user switches back to Alacritty right away. I would expect two design choices:\r\n1. A user finishes typing in Alacritty, switches to a different app, and switches back to Alacritty with the mouse visible. Then the user starts to type, the mouse is hidden again. The fix would support this logic: the cursor is visible whenever Alacritty gets focused. Let's call it mouse visibilities' eager mode. \r\n2. A user finishes typing in Alacritty, switches to a different app, and switches back to Alacritty with the mouse **invisible**. If the user starts to type, the mouse remains invisible. Otherwise the user gives mouse input, the cursor is shown. In this case, the mouse is shown *lazily*. The mouse hidden as long as there is no cursor input, and the mouse is shown only when the user gives mouse input.\r\n\r\nWhich design do people prefer? I am looking forward to receiving feedback on this.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1296115182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SheldonZhong","id":12372003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzcyMDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12372003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong","html_url":"https://github.com/SheldonZhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheldonZhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1296392083","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6452#issuecomment-1296392083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6452","id":1296392083,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85NRV-T","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T00:17:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T00:17:27Z","body":"@SheldonZhong It should still work fine when we call `set_mouse_visible(true)` in both branch cases, right?

Commit below implements option 2 described [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6452#issuecomment-1296115182). On macOS at least, each window has its cursor visibility tracked separately, and this persists across focus changes, so there's no need to explicitly make the cursor visible when leaving the window, as the system already does this if the newly-focused window has a visible cursor. I still need to check other platforms, though.\r\nUpdate: Windows looks good, but it behaves slightly differently in the multi-Alacritty-window case: with two overlapping windows that both have the cursor hidden from typing, if you have the cursor in the overlapping region, move the mouse, and then alt-tab to the other window that still has the cursor \"hidden\", the cursor will remain visible, whereas on macOS the cursor will be hidden in the second window still. If you switch from an Alacritty window to another app's window, everything works the way I would expect; cursor is immediately visible in the other app, and is invisible when switching back to Alacritty.\r\nUpdate 2: X11 is similar to Windows. Alt-tab reveals the cursor immediately regardless of whether you are switching to another Alacritty window or whether that window previously hid its cursor.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chrisnc/alacritty/commit/bf18866c1b47bbd19e590f639c5da6af6fc288b9","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1309642057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisnc","id":2592855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2592855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7779753672,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop85U8AdwzwAAAAHPtZ7I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7779753672","actor":{"login":"chrisnc","id":2592855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2592855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"56cb064fdb6fcefdccb276217746d96452931a07","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisnc/alacritty/commits/56cb064fdb6fcefdccb276217746d96452931a07","created_at":"2022-11-10T05:29:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisnc","id":2592855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTI4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2592855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T05:33:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T05:33:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/6481","id":1443283035,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAxkop85CloLj","number":6481,"title":"Don't
