a shell process exits with children still alive (typically due to the\r\n`disown` shell builtin), POLLHUP will not be sent to the master PTY file\r\ndescriptor. This is due to the fact that the disowned process still has\r\nthe slave PTY open as its STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR.\r\n\r\nIf a disowned process never reads or writes from its file descriptors\r\n(which is often the case for graphical applications), the event loop\r\nwill end up blocking on poll()/select() when not handling user input\r\nreceived over the mio channel. When Alacritty shuts down and joins on the\r\nevent loop thread, there can never be any more input on the mio channel -\r\nthe main thread is no longer handling user keystrokes from the window. Unless\r\na disowned process happens to access its slave PTY file descriptors, the\r\nevent loop will never get the chance to deetect that it should exit.\r\n\r\nThis commit extends the `Msg` enum to include an explicit `Shutdown`\r\nmessage, which ensures a clean shutdown (e.g. closing the 'recording'\r\nfile). This allows the select()/poll() call to remain blocking, instead\r\nof needing to periodically check the shutdown state in between\r\ntimed-out calls.\r\n\r\nFixes #339","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1096066572,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTA5NjA2NjU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1096066572","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-24T17:56:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1096066651,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwOTYwNjY2NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1096066651","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"876dc151527cac0db1c319af0f0c95158bdf1806","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/876dc151527cac0db1c319af0f0c95158bdf1806","created_at":"2017-05-24T17:56:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1574621223,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NzQ2MjEyMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1574621223","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a6f806d25ccbd918b17a77d99caacf5ca1f14e9f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/a6f806d25ccbd918b17a77d99caacf5ca1f14e9f","created_at":"2018-04-14T16:50:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
