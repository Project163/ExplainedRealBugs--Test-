difference between glibc's `daemon()` and yours is that glibc calls `_exit(2)`, while you call `std::process::exit(0)`, which I assume maps to `exit(3)`.\r\n\r\n`exit(3)` will cause at-exit handlers to run (registered with either `atexit(3)` or `on_exit(3)`).\r\n`_exit(2)` terminates the process \"immediately\".","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/480566604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dnkl","id":14031526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14031526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl","html_url":"https://github.com/dnkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/480581122","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2259#issuecomment-480581122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2259","id":480581122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDU4MTEyMg==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-07T11:19:36Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T11:19:46Z","body":"Huh
