For example, if I open Alacritty in `C:\\home` my prompt says `PS Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::\\\\?\\C:\\home>`. Other than the long prompt, everything seems to work properly. If I run `cd C:\\home` then the prompt appears how I would expect it to on startup: `PS C:\\home>`. Oddly enough, if I start a powershell 6 terminal, then run `alacritty.exe` inside there, the resulting instance of Alacritty does not have this long prompt. It does print `Cannot load PSReadline module.  Console is running without PSReadline.` above the prompt only in that case though.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.4.1 (4d9253b)\r\nWindows: ConPTY\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
