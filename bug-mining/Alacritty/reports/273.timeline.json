For the record, this issue has been reported upstream too. https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457867\r\n\r\nAfter my quick debugging, I see an issue on client side. In particular, it appears like alacritty calls `xdg_surface.set_window_geometry` without attached buffer before receiving the first configure event. This is a no-no thing, most compositors silently handle that, but there's a proposal to make it a protocol error because it makes no sense to call set_window_geometry without a buffer.\r\n\r\nI believe that this maximization issue is going to be resolved if alacritty starts updating the window geometry when there's a buffer. For example, this is alacritty's wayland debug log when running with kwin_wayland\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1256207.528]  -> wl_compositor@4.create_surface(new id wl_surface@3)\r\n[1256207.531]  ->

case.\r\n\r\nNote that the behavior may differ across compositors because every compositor handles async geometry updates differently, but alacritty should not touch the window geometry until it attaches a buffer.\r\n\r\nThis is most likely a bug in whatever toolkit alacritty uses under the hood.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1245570285/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zzag","id":19847234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODQ3MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19847234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag","html_url":"https://github.com/zzag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7377758560,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85NK43TzwAAAAG3v6lg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7377758560","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-13T15:21:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7377758566,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85NK43TzwAAAAG3v6lm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7377758566","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-13T15:21:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1245847867","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6184#issuecomment-1245847867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6184","id":1245847867,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85KQiE7","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-13T19:10:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T19:10:58Z","body":"That's actually a disaster for us. Since it would mean that on wayland will have a special handling of that. The problem is that.\r\n\r\n1. We create a Window\r\n2. We run an event_loop and commit buffers via swap buffers. This will be even more interesting since it'll become on a different thread latter on.\r\n\r\nAnd given that swap buffers and window handling is done by 2 different libraries and we have multiple threads/windows involved it means that we're better off not using the request at all.\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure we can solve that for multithreaded apps reliably given that you must create event queues around for that in the current design.\r\n\r\nIt's always nice that protocols got adjusted over time due and compositors change behavior for a stable protocols in such ways. Since this code was working without issues for like years in multiple compositors and started to break only when realization came.
