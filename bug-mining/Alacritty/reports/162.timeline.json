editing a `PKGBUILD` file with the [`o`](https://github.com/xyproto/o) text editor, then repeatedly alternating between frenetically resizing the window and pressing `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-e`, until Alacritty crashed. I could not find the exact steps to reproduce this, it seems to crash after crossing a certain threshold of abusive window resizing.\r\n\r\nThis small patch seems to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexander F.
