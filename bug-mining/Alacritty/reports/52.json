Everything with respect to the keymap works great (as far as I can tell) except for Cmd-key combinations.  Here's what I'm seeing with `--print-events` when I type Cmd-v (which should paste, but instead just types 'v'):\r\n\r\n```\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Pressed, 55, Some(LWin), , None)\r\nglutin event: ReceivedCharacter('v')\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Pressed, 47, Some(Period), SUPER, Some(\"v\"))\r\nglutin event: Awakened\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Released, 47, Some(Period), SUPER, None)\r\nglutin event: KeyboardInput(Released, 55, Some(LWin), , None)\r\n```\r\nPeriod on the QWERTY keyboard corresponds to \"v\" in Dvorak, so it seems as though for some reason, with the Cmd-key down, alacritty is getting the raw- not OS-remapped- key events? In the event in question, both `Some(Period)` and `Some(\"v\")` are in the event.\r\n\r\nAn awkward but effective workaround is to use these keybindings:\r\n```\r\n  - { key: I,        mods: Command, action: Copy                         }\r\n  - { key: Period,   mods: Command, action: Paste                        }\r\n  - { key: X,        mods: Command, action: Quit                         }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/458/reactions","total_count":33,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
