the following configuration snippet:\r\n```\r\n#Select hint text\r\n[[hints.enabled]]\r\naction          = \"Select\"\r\nhyperlinks      = true\r\nmouse.enabled   = true\r\n#mouse.mods      = \"Alt\"\r\n```\r\nThe Select action select the whole line containing the hint, not just the hint text. \r\nFor example:\r\nIf I do something like `ls -l --hyperlink=auto` only the files get underlined as I hover over them, but when clicked the whole line is selected.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't change even if I uncoment the `mouse.mods` line.\r\n\r\nIs this the intended behavior?\r\n\r\nThe man 5 alacritty states:\r\n```\r\nSelect\r\n                   Select the hint's text.\r\n```\r\nSo I would expect only the hint's text to be selected.\r\n\r\nIf it's not a bug / the current behavior is already established, would you consider something like \"SelectHintOnly\" action?\r\n\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux (Fedora 38)\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.13.1\r\nLinux/BSD: X11, KDE5 /
