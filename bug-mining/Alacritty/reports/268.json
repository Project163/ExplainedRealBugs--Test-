The clipboard has never really worked on Wayland, it's consistently a mess. Talks with @chrisduerr and @cmr suggested that it should be fixed on master.\r\n\r\nToday I compiled master with rustc 1.34.2 to try, and it seems like it is still not working.\r\n\r\n# How to reproduce\r\n1. Running Sway (might work on other Wayland WMs?)\r\n2. Open Firefox with `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` set.\r\n3. Select and copy some text on Firefox.\r\n4. Switch to another workspace where Alacritty is.\r\n5. Paste text (ctrl+shift+v)\r\n\r\nThe result should be a freeze and eventually a crash.\r\n\r\nOn a release build I get this:\r\n```\r\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: EventsLoopClosed', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\nnote: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a debug build with backtracing I get this:\r\n```\r\nalacritty on  master via 𝗥 v1.34.2 [I] ➜ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cr\r\n   Compiling alacritty v0.3.2 (/home/bemeurer/src/alacritty/alacritty)\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 7.18s\r\n     Running `target/debug/alacritty`\r\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: EventsLoopClosed', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\nnote: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0: std::sys::unix::backtrace::tracing::imp::unwind_backtrace\r\n             at src/libstd/sys/unix/backtrace/tracing/gcc_s.rs:39\r\n   1: std::sys_common::backtrace::print\r\n             at src/libstd/sys_common/backtrace.rs:70\r\n             at src/libstd/sys_common/backtrace.rs:58\r\n   2: std::panicking::default_hook::{{closure}}\r\n             at src/libstd/panicking.rs:200\r\n   3: std::panicking::default_hook\r\n             at src/libstd/panicking.rs:215\r\n   4: std::panicking::rust_panic_with_hook\r\n             at src/libstd/panicking.rs:478\r\n   5: std::panicking::continue_panic_fmt\r\n             at src/libstd/panicking.rs:385\r\n   6: rust_begin_unwind\r\n             at src/libstd/panicking.rs:312\r\n   7: core::panicking::panic_fmt\r\n             at src/libcore/panicking.rs:85\r\n   8: core::result::unwrap_failed\r\n             at /var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/rust-1.34.2/work/rustc-1.34.2-src/src/libcore/macros.rs:17\r\n   9: <core::result::Result<T, E>>::unwrap\r\n             at /var/tmp/portage/dev-lang/rust-1.34.2/work/rustc-1.34.2-src/src/libcore/result.rs:798\r\n  10: winit::platform::platform::wayland::keyboard::init_keyboard::{{closure}}\r\n             at /home/bemeurer/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/winit-0.19.1/src/platform/linux/wayland/keyboard.rs:111\r\n  11: smithay_client_toolkit::keyboard::implement_kbd::{{closure}}::{{closure}}::{{closure}}\r\n             at /home/bemeurer/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/smithay-client-toolkit-0.4.5/src/keyboard/mod.rs:720\r\n\r\n\r\n^C\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2453/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
