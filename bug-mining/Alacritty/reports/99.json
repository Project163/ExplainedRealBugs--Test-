X11\r\n\r\nThis issue might be more question on how to debug this rather than there is an actual issue. Recently I updated alacritty to the latest master (dbce674d7012fe09b3ab9ac0aeeb1c748bb7afce) and install using `cargo deb --install`. My opacity setting is no longer being applied. I have also recently gotten an external gpu and have been messing with the gpu drivers (switching between nvidia versions and nouveau) so I'm not necessarily convinced this is an issue with the latest Alacritty. When running under sway window manager the opacity works, but under gnome (3.32) on X11 the opacity setting does not. \r\n\r\nI have tried running alacritty with the `-vvv` option but haven't seen any errors or logs that seem relevant. I'm still learning about how all the pieces work together recently switching over from mac to linux so I'm not sure where to look next for why the opacity is not working.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2254/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
